    "text": "1.1 The Question of Interpretation\nPropositional logic classifies propositions into main categories: true and false. Modal logic makes further distinctions between modes in which a proposition may be true or false: necessarily true, possibly true, necessarily false, possibly false. The formal framework of modal logic expands the language of propositional logic with a sentential operator, \\(\\Box\\), for one of those modes, necessity, and a dual operator, \\(\\Diamond\\), for another, possibility.\nThere are, however, other interpretations of the formalism.\nThese distinctions may play a crucial role in philosophical argumentation.\nHow should we interpret the formalism? We use truth tables to interpret the language of propositional logic because propositional connectives are truth-functional, e.g., the truth value of a conjunction is a function of the truth values of its conjuncts. The strategy does not seem to be available in the case of modal logic, since the modal operator \\(\\Box\\) is not truth-functional:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\varphi & \\Box \\varphi \\\\\n\\hline\nT  & ? \\\\\n\\hline\nF  &  F \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\varphi\\) is false, \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) will of course be false. But the truth of \\(\\varphi\\) leaves open whether \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is true or false, e.g., \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) will be true when \\(\\varphi\\) is a tautology but false when \\(\\varphi\\) is interpreted to make a contingent statement.\nOne may attempt to overcome this limitation with the help of a more fine-grained distinction between necessary and contingent truths, on the one hand, and necessary and contingent falsehoods, on the other. We may even reserve the letters \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) for contingent and necessary truths respectively, and we may similarly use \\(f\\) and \\(F\\) for contingent and necessary falsehoods respectively. This appears to suggests a truth table for each negation and \\(\\Box\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\varphi & \\neg \\varphi & \\Box \\varphi\\\\\n\\hline\nT  & F & T\\\\\n\\hline\nt  &  f & F\\\\\n\\hline\nF  & T & F\\\\\n\\hline\nf  &  t & F\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe problem remains that we cannot generalize the scheme to cover binary propositional connectives such as the material connective. Once we opt for the more fine-grained distinction between necessary and contingent truths and falsehoods, the truth value of the conditional ceases to be a function of the truth values of antecedent and consequent.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\to & T & t & F & f\\\\\n\\hline\nT  & T & t & F  &  f \\\\\n\\hline\nt  &  T & ? & F &  f\\\\\n\\hline\nF  & T & T & T & T \\\\\n\\hline\nf  &  T & t & t & ? \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are contingently true, \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) may be necessarily true, e.g., \\(p \\to p\\) if \\(p\\) is contingently true, or merely contingently true, e.g., \\(p\\to q\\) for suitable choices of contingent propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Likewise, when \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are contingently false, the conditional may be necessarily or contingently true.",

    "section": "1.2 Possible Worlds",
    "text": "1.2 Possible Worlds\nWe must look elsewhere for an interpretation of the formalism of propositional modal logic. One key observation at this point is that propositions differ not just with respect to whether they are true or false, they may differ with respect to the circumstances under which they are true or false. The propositions expressed by the statements ‘Los Angeles has over three million inhabitants’ and ‘Kilimanjaro rises to 5,895 meters’ are both true but there are possible circumstances under which one is true and the other is false.\nWe may think of possible worlds as complete specifications of a way the world might be, and we may ask whether a sentence is true at a possible world. That is, we may ask whether the possible world in question specifies circumstances under which the sentence is in fact true.\nOnce we take on board the thought that a sentence may be true when evaluated with respect to one possible world but not when evaluated with respect to another, we may ask what is for a possible world to be possible relative to another. The proposition that I’m a philosopher is true given how the world is, but there are possible circumstances under which I’m an engineer. We codify that as the thought that a world at which I’m an engineer is possible with respect to the world of evaluation. We will call a possible world is accessible from another world if the former is possible with respect to the latter.\nWe now have the basic ingredients for a possible world semantics for propositional modal logic. More formally, a model for the framework will consist of a collection of possible worlds \\(W\\), an accessibility relation \\(R\\) on the collection \\(W\\), and a valuation function, which specifies which propositions are true at what possible worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Possible Worlds Model\n\n\n\nHere is a depiction of a possible worlds model, which consists of a set \\(W\\) of four worlds and a binary relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\). The model verifies \\(p\\) at \\(w_3\\) and \\(w_4\\), and it verifies \\(q\\) at \\(w_2\\) and \\(w_4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA negation \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is false at that world.\nA material conditional \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) just in case \\(\\varphi\\) is false at \\(w\\) or \\(\\psi\\) is true at \\(w\\).\nA formula \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is true at every world \\(u\\) to which \\(w\\) is related.\nA formula \\(\\Diamond \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is true at some world \\(u\\) to which \\(w\\) is related.\n\nConsider the premises and conclusion of the modal ontological argument:\n\n\\(p \\to \\Box p\\) is true in every world in the model.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\(\\Box (p \\to \\Box p)\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Diamond p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Box p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Diamond \\Box p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(p\\) is true at \\(w_3\\) and \\(w_4\\) but not at either \\(w_1\\) or \\(w_2\\).\n\nIt follows that \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) are each a world that verifies every premise of the argument but not its conclusion.\nIt will turn out that the validity of the argument for the existence of numbers turns on the structure of the accessibility relation. That is, the argument will be valid when we restrict attention to models in which the accessibility relation is either symmetric or models in which the accessibility relation is reflexive and euclidean.1",

(3+1)}{2}\\\\\n\\cdots & = & \\cdots & = & \\cdots \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIf the pattern is completely general, then we may conjecture that the sum of the first \\(100\\) positive integers to be \\(5050\\), which is \\(\\frac{100.(100 +1)}{2}\\).\nWe can use an induction on the positive integers to prove the generalization:\nFor every positive integer \\(n\\), \\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}.\n\\]\nHere the condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) is: \\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nBy induction on the positive integers, it suffices to show two claims:\n\n\\(\\Phi(1)\\), \\[\n\\sum_{n = 1}^{1} = \\frac{1.(1+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\\(\\Phi(n)\\) only if \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nThat is, suppose:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}.\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} & = & \\sum_{k=1}^{n} + (n+1)\\\\  & =  & \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2} + (n+1)\\\\\n& = & \\frac{n^2 + 3n +2}{2} \\\\\n& = &\\frac{(n+1).((n+1)+1)}{2}  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]So, we conclude that every positive integer \\(n\\) satisfies the condition.\n\n\nA word of caution. The principle of induction becomes all too powerful when it is misused. Here is an example of how a misapplication of mathematical induction can lead us astray. Let me give you some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Not to Use Induction\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\Phi(n)\\) be the condition on positive integers:\n\nIf \\(A\\) is a set of \\(n\\) students, then they all share a birthday.\n\nBy induction on the positive integers, it suffices to show two claims:\n\n\\(\\Phi(1)\\).\nBut of course, if \\(A\\) is a singleton, then there is just one birthday.\n\\(\\Phi(n)\\) only if \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nFor the sake of concreteness, let me pass from \\(3\\) to \\(4\\). Suppose \\(A\\) contains four students \\(a, b, c, d\\). On the assumption that \\(\\Phi(3)\\), we know both that \\(a, b, c\\) share a birthday and that \\(b, c, d\\) share a birthday. So, \\(a, b, c, d\\) must share a birthday.\nWe may generalize the argument for other cases as well.\n\nIt would seem to follow that no matter what \\(n\\) may be, a set of \\(n\\) students must share a birthday. Therefore, all students must share a birthday.\nThe conclusion is false, but where exactly is the flaw in the argument?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Not to Use Induction\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\Phi(n)\\) be the following condition on natural numbers:\n\nif two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, then \\(|A|=|B|\\).\n\nThat is, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, then they are equinumerous, i.e., they can be put in one-to-one correspondence.\nWe proceed in two steps:\n\n\\(\\Phi(0)\\).\nSuppose two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(0\\) elements. Then. \\(A =\\emptyset =B\\).\n\\(\\Phi(n)\\) only if \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nSuppose \\(\\Phi(n)\\) and let now \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two sets with at most \\(n+1\\) elements. Now, consider the sets \\(A^-\\) and \\(B^-\\), which arise from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) by substracting just one element \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from each set. By inductive hypothesis, since \\(A^-\\) and \\(B^-\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, they are equinumerous. But if they are, so will \\(A^- \\cup \\{a\\}\\) and \\(B^- \\cup \\{b\\}\\), which are none other than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nIt would seem to follow that no two sets with \\(n\\) of fewer elements differ in cardinality, which would mean that no two finite sets differ in cardinality.\nThat gives us the absurd conclusion that all finite sets are equinumerous.\nWhere exactly is the flaw in the argument? The problem lies in the assumption that no matter what set we are given, we may, if we like, take away one element, which is not the case with the empty set.\n\n\nWe will sometimes rely on alternative but equivalent forms of induction:\n\nProposition 2.7 (Complete Induction) Given a condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) on natural numbers, if\n\n\\(\\Phi(0)\\), and\nfor all \\(m \\leq n\\), \\(\\Phi(m)\\) only if \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\n\nthen for every natural number \\(n\\), \\(\\Phi(n)\\).\n\nEquivalently:\n\nProposition 2.8 (Complete Induction without a Base Case) Given a condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) on natural numbers, if\n\nfor all \\(m &lt; n\\), \\(\\Phi(n)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n)\\),\n\nthen for every* natural number \\(n\\), \\(\\Phi(n)\\).\n\nNotice that \\(\\Phi(0)\\) will be true if the conditional above holds, for it will be vacuously true that all natural numbers less than \\(0\\) satisfy the condition \\(\\Phi\\).\nWe will often define infinite sets by recursion, which is closely connected to induction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nWe define a set of factorial numbers by recursion on the natural numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{F} := 1 | (n+1).F(n)\n\\]\nHere is how to read that notation. We generate the factorial numbers by specifying\n\\[\nF(0) = 1\n\\]\nand by explaining how to move from \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+1)\\):\n\\[\nF(n+1) = (n+1). F(n)\n\\]\nThe factorial number \\(F(n)\\) is commonly written as \\(n!\\). So, a number is a factorial number if it is \\(F(0)\\), namely, \\(1\\), or if it can be reached by repeated application of the rule that takes one from \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+1)\\). That means that the set of factorial numbers include:\n\\[\n1 \\ 2 \\ 6 \\ 24 \\ \\cdots\n\\]\nIn other words, a number is factorial if and only if we may eventually reach that number by a finite number of application of the rules included in the definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nYou could define by recursion a set of formulas for a formal language. Suppose we start with a simple vocabulary, which consists of only three symbols:\n\\[\n@, \\#, \\%\n\\]\nWe could define a set of formulas for that language by means of the following recursion:\n\\[\n\\varphi ::= @ \\ | \\  \\% \\varphi \\ | \\ (\\varphi \\ \\#  \\ \\psi)\n\\]\nHere is how to read that notation now.\n\n\\(@\\) is a formula of the language\nif \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula of the language, then \\(\\% \\varphi\\) is a formula\nif \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas of the language, then \\((\\varphi \\ \\# \\ \\psi)\\) is a formula.\n\nThat means that the set of formulas of the language includes:\n\\[\n@, \\%@, \\%\\% @, \\dots, (@ \\ \\# \\ @), (@ \\ \\# \\% @), \\% (@ \\ \\# \\ @), \\dots\n\\]",

Therefore \\(\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi\\).\nCase 4. \\(\\chi_k = (\\chi_l \\to \\psi)\\) for some \\(k, l &lt; n\\)\nThat means that \\((\\chi_l \\to \\psi)\\) and \\(\\chi_l\\) are each in the sequence, which means that there are derivations \\((\\chi_1 \\dots, \\chi_l \\to \\psi)\\) and \\((\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_l)\\) of each formula \\(\\chi_l \\to \\psi\\) and \\(\\chi_l\\) from \\(\\Gamma, \\varphi\\) of length \\(&lt; n\\).\nSince both derivations have length strictly less than \\(n\\), by inductive hypothesis, \\(\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi \\to (\\chi_l \\to \\psi)\\) and \\(\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi \\to \\chi_l\\).\nTo build a derivation of \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) from \\(\\Gamma\\), we may concatenate derivations of \\(\\varphi \\to (\\chi_1 \\to \\psi)\\) and \\(\\varphi \\to \\chi_l\\), respectively, from \\(\\Gamma\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n& & ... & \\\\\n& & \\vdots & \\\\\nk & & \\varphi \\to  (\\chi_l \\to \\psi) & \\Gamma \\vdash  \\varphi \\to  (\\chi_l \\to \\psi) \\\\\n& & \\vdots & \\\\\nm & & \\varphi \\to  \\chi_l & \\Gamma \\vdash  \\varphi \\to  \\chi_l\\\\\n& & \\vdots & \\\\\nn& & ((\\varphi \\to (\\chi_1 \\to \\psi)) \\to  & \\textsf{A2}[\\varphi/p,\\chi_l/q,\\psi/r]\\\\\n& & ((\\varphi \\to \\chi_l)\\to (\\varphi \\to \\psi)) & \\\\\nn+1& & (\\varphi \\to \\chi_l)\\to (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & \\textsf{MP} \\ k, n\\\\\nn+2 & & \\varphi \\to \\psi & \\textsf{MP} \\ m, n+1\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] We conclude that given \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\varphi\\), if \\(( \\chi_1, ..., \\chi_n)\\) is a derivation of a formula \\(\\psi\\) from \\(\\Gamma, \\varphi\\), then \\(\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi\\).\n\nThe deduction theorem encodes a common method of proof in mathematics. To establish a conditional \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) in a mathematical context, you may simply adjoin \\(\\varphi\\) to your assumptions \\(\\Gamma\\) and set out to derive \\(\\psi\\) from them. That entitles you to conclude that \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) is a deductive consequence of the original assumptions.\nWe will now use of the Deduction Theorem to prove some facts, which will

That is what would make the axiom system sound. On the other hand, we want to be able to derive a formula \\(\\varphi\\) from a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a logical consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\). That is what would make the axiom system complete. We now set out to justify that the axiom system we have described is both sound and complete.\nHere is an important observation:\nWe have the toolkit we need in order to prove the completeness of the axiom system.\nWe follow an indirect route toward that conclusion.\nThat will suffice for our purposes. For given a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and a formula \\(\\varphi\\), if \\(\\Gamma \\nvdash \\varphi\\), then by prop 3.6, \\(\\Gamma, \\neg \\varphi\\) is consistent. Given the link between consistency and satisfiability, we would infer that \\(\\Gamma, \\neg \\varphi\\) is satisfiable, whence \\(\\Gamma \\not \\models \\varphi\\).\nWe reach our target, we will proceed to justify two double-arrows from the diagram below.\nThe first step is to extend a consistent set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) to a maximal consistent set \\(\\Sigma\\) (Lindenbaum Lemma.) Next, we will argue that every maximal consistent set is satisfiable (Henkin Lemma).\nProof. We begin with an enumeration of the formulas of propositional logic: \\[\n\\varphi_0, \\varphi_1, \\cdots, \\varphi_n, \\cdots\n\\] Given \\(\\Gamma\\) be a consistent set of formulas, we build a maximal consistent superset \\(\\Sigma\\) by the recursion: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Sigma_0 &  = &  \\Gamma \\\\\n\\Sigma_{n+1} & = & \\begin{cases} \\Sigma_n, \\varphi_n & \\text{if that set is consistent}\\\\ \\Sigma_n &  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n\\] We let \\[\n\\Sigma = \\bigcup_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Sigma_n.\n\\]We now argue that \\(\\Sigma\\) is a maximal consistent superset of \\(\\Gamma\\).\nWe proceed in several steps.\nThis is because \\(\\Gamma = \\Sigma_0\\) and \\(\\Sigma_0 \\subseteq \\Sigma\\).\nIt follows from the above that every finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent. We now argue that \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent as well.\nWe conclude that \\(\\Sigma\\) is a maximal consistent superset of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\nIt remains to show that a maximal consistent set of formulas is satisfiable.",

The language affords us the means to distinguish reflexive from non-reflexive frames in terms of the validity of the formula \\(\\Box p \\to p\\). Likewise, we have the means to make distinctions between symmetric and non-symmetric frames or between transitive and non-transitive frames.\nFirst-order languages are able to make similar distinctions.

Even if the class of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive frames are each modal and first-order definable, one may wonder whether every class of formulas defined by a first-order formula is modally definable and, vice versa, whether every modally definable frame is first-order definable.\nThe answer to both questions is ‘no’. Some formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) are able to modally define classes of frames that are not first-order definable, and some classes of frames that are first-order definable are not modally definable by a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrames\nModal Definability\nFirst-Order Definability\n\n\n\n\nIrreflexive\nNo\n\\(\\forall x \\ \\neg Rxx\\)\n\n\nUniversal\nNo\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y Rxy\\)\n\n\nTransitive Converse Well-Founded\n\\(\\Box (\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\)\nNo\n\n\nIdentity\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (Rxy \\leftrightarrow x = y)\\)\n\n\nFunctional\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (Rxy \\wedge Rxz \\to x =y)\\)\n\n\nSerial\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\exists y Rxy\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverse Well-Founded\n\n\n\nA binary relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(W\\) converse well-founded iff there are no infinite ascending \\(R\\)-chains of the form \\(x_1Rx_2 \\cdots x_nRx_{n+1} \\cdots\\).\n\n\n\nProposition 5.3 The class of transitive converse well-founded frames is not first-order definable.\n\nThis is a consequence of the Compactness Theorem for first-order logic: if a set of first-order formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) is finitely satisfiable, then \\(\\Gamma\\) is finitely satisfiable.\n\nProof.

Either way, \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash p\\) and \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash \\Box p \\to p\\). So, \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\). So, \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\).\nNow, suppose \\(R\\) is not converse well-founded. Then there is an infinite \\(R\\)-chain \\(u_1 Ru_2 \\dots u_nRu_{n+1} \\dots\\). In that case, we efine \\(V(p)\\) to exclude every member of the \\(R\\)-chain, that is, \\(V(p) = W \\setminus \\{u_1, u_2, \\dots\\}\\). Given some \\(w \\in X\\), we argue that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\) even though \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\). For the former, note that \\((W, R, V), u_n \\nVdash \\Box p\\) for each member \\(u_n\\) of the infinite \\(R\\)-chain. So, \\((W, R, V), u_n \\Vdash \\Box p  \\to p\\) and \\((W, R, V), u_n \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p  \\to p)\\) for every member \\(u_n\\) of the infinite \\(R\\)-chain. So, \\((W, R, V), u_n \\nVdash \\Box (\\Box p  \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\) for every member \\(u_n\\) of the infinite \\(R\\)-chain.\n(\\(\\Leftarrow\\)) Suppose \\(R\\) is transitive and converse well-founded. Furthermore, let \\((W, R, V)\\) be a model based on \\((W, R)\\) and let \\(w \\in W\\). We now argue that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\to \\Box p\\). For suppose \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\) and consider the set \\(X=\\{u \\in W: wRu \\wedge u\\notin V(p) \\}\\). We know that this set is non-empty since \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\). Since \\(R\\) is converse well-founded, there is some \\(v \\in X\\) such that \\(\\neg vRt\\) for any \\(t\\in X\\). Otherwise, we would have an infinite \\(R\\)-chain. Since \\(v\\in X\\), we have that \\((W, R, V), v \\nVdash p\\), despite the fact that if \\(vRt\\), by transitivity, \\(wRt\\) and since \\(t\\notin X\\), \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash p\\). So, \\((W, R, V), v \\Vdash \\Box p\\) and \\((W, R, V), v \\nVdash \\Box p \\to p\\). It follows that \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Bisimulations\nWe know that first-order formulas do not discriminate between isomorphic models. The role of isomorphism in first-order logic is played by bisimulation in modal propositional logic, since modal formulas do not discriminate between bisimilar models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBisimulation\n\n\n\nA bisimulation between two models \\((W, R, V)\\) and \\((W', R', V')\\) is a binary relation \\(E \\subseteq W \\times W'\\) such that for all \\(w\\in W\\) forall \\(w' \\in W'\\),\n\nif \\(wEw'\\), then \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) verify exactly the same propositional variables in each model, that is, for all propositional variable \\(p\\), \\(w \\in V(p)\\) iff \\(w' \\in V'(p)\\).\nif \\(wEw'\\) and \\(Rwu\\) for some \\(u\\in W\\), then there is some \\(u'\\in W'\\) such that \\(Rw'u'\\) and \\(uEu'\\) (the forth condition)\nif \\(wEw'\\) and \\(Rw'u'\\) for some \\(u'\\in W'\\), then there is some \\(u \\in W\\) such that \\(Rwu\\) and \\(u'Eu\\) (the back condition)\n\n\n\nIf \\(E\\) is a bisimulation between two models \\((W, R, V)\\) and \\((W', R', V')\\), we will call them bisimilar. Furthermore, if \\(wEw'\\), we will write that the two worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) are bisimilar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nThere is a bisimulation \\(E \\subseteq W \\times W'\\) between the models depicted below:\n\n\n\n\\((W, R, V)\\)\n\\((W', R', V')\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(E\\) relates \\(w_1\\) to each \\(u_1\\) and \\(v_2\\), and \\(E\\) relates each of \\(u_1\\) and \\(v_1\\) to \\(w_1\\).\n\\(E\\) relates \\(w_2\\) to each \\(u_2\\) and \\(v_2\\), and \\(E\\) relates each of \\(u_2\\) and \\(v_2\\) to \\(w_2\\).\nOne way to think of the situation is that \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) have each unfolded into two duplicate worlds \\(u_1\\) and \\(v_1\\) and \\(u_2\\) and \\(v_2\\), respectively. Notice, however, that the two models verify exactly the same formulas of propositional modal logic.\n\n\n\nProposition 5.5 (Invariance Lemma) If there is a bisimulation \\(E\\) between two models \\((W, R, V)\\) and \\((W', R', V')\\), then for all \\(w\\in W\\), for all \\(w'\\in W'\\), if \\(wEw'\\), the for every formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n(W, R), w \\Vdash \\varphi & \\text{iff} &  (W', R'), w' \\Vdash \\varphi.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nProof. The proof is by induction over the complexity of formulas.\n\nBase Case. If \\(\\varphi\\) is a propositional variable \\(p\\), then if \\(wEw'\\), by clause 1 in the definition of bisimulation, \\(w \\in V(p)\\) iff \\(w' \\in V'(p)\\), which means\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n(W, R, V), w \\Vdash p & \\text{iff} &  w \\in V(p) &\\\\\n                        &   &  w' \\in V'(p) & \\text{Clause 1}\\\\\n                        &   &  (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash p &\n\\end{array}\n\\] The Boolean cases are immediate:\n\nInductive Step for \\(\\neg\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n(W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi & \\text{iff} &  (W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\varphi & \\\\\n                        &   &  (W', R', V'), w' \\nVdash \\varphi & IH \\\\\n                             &   &  (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] On to the case of \\(\\to\\):\n\nInductive Step for \\(\\to\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n(W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi & \\text{iff} &  (W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\varphi  \\  \\text{or} \\  (W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\psi & \\\\\n                        &   &  (W', R', V'), w' \\nVdash \\varphi \\  \\text{or} \\  (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\psi  & IH \\\\\n                             &   &  (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi& \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] The case for \\(\\Box\\) requires more attention:\n\nInductive Step for \\(\\Box\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n(W, R), w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi  & \\text{iff} &  (W, R), u \\Vdash \\varphi  \\ \\  \\text{whenever} \\ \\ wRu & \\\\\n                        &   &   (W', R'), u' \\Vdash \\varphi  \\ \\ \\text{whenever} \\ \\ w'R'u'  & \\text{Clauses 2, 3, and} \\ IH\\\\\n                             &   &  (W', R'), w' \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi& \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nHere is a more detailed justification of the step from \\((W, R), u \\Vdash \\varphi\\) whenever \\(u \\in W\\) and \\(wRu\\) to \\((W', R'), u' \\Vdash \\varphi\\) whenever \\(u' \\in W'\\):\n\nSuppose \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash \\varphi\\) whenever \\(u \\in W\\) and \\(wRu\\). We now argue that if \\(wEw'\\), then \\((W', R', V'), u' \\Vdash \\varphi\\) whenever \\(u' \\in W'\\) and \\(w'Ru'\\). For if \\(w'R'u'\\), then, by clause 2 or the back condition, there is some \\(u \\in W\\) such that \\(Rwu\\) and \\(uEu'\\). Since \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi\\), \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash \\varphi\\), and by the Inductive Hypothesis, \\((W', R', V'), u' \\Vdash \\varphi\\) as required. So, we infer \\((W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi\\).\n\nThe converse direction is completely parallel but it makes use of clause 2 or the forth condition instead.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nBisimulations are used to rule out the definability of some classes of frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nEach model of the form \\((W, R, V)\\) is bisimilar to some irreflexive model of the form \\((W', R', V')\\).\nIn broad outline, given a model \\((W, R, V)\\), we will build a model \\((W', R', V')\\), which replace each reflexive world \\(w\\in W\\), that is, each world that is accessible from itself, with a pair of duplicate worlds \\(w^+\\) and \\(w^-\\) in \\(W'\\), which are accessible from each other by \\(R'\\) but such that none of them is accessible from itself by \\(R'\\). We then proceed to make sure that for each propositional variable \\(p\\), each duplicate \\(w^+\\) and \\(w^-\\) is a member of \\(V'(p)\\) if \\(w \\in V(p)\\) in the original model. Otherwise, \\(R'\\) and \\(V'\\) behave exactly like \\(R\\) and \\(V\\) in the original model.1\nIt is not difficult to verify that \\((W, R, V)\\) is bisimilar to \\((W', R', V')\\), which means that they verify exactly the same formulas. This is because the relation \\(E\\), which relates each reflexive world \\(w \\in W\\) with its duplicates \\(w^+\\) and \\(w^-\\) in \\(W'\\) and relates every other world \\(u\\in W\\) with itself is a bisimulation between the two models.\n\n\n\nProposition 5.6 (Modal Undefinability for Irreflexive Frames) No formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) modally defines the class of irreflexive frames.\n\n\nProof. No formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) is valid in all and only irreflexive frames. For suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is valid only in irreflexive frames. That means that if \\(R\\) is not irreflexive on \\(W\\), then there is some model \\((W, R, V)\\) based on \\((W, R)\\) such that \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Then, given our previous observation, there is a bisimilar irreflexive model \\((W', R', V')\\) where \\((W', R', V') \\nVdash \\varphi\\). But notice that since \\((W', R', V')\\) is based on an irreflexive frame \\((W', R')\\), we conclude that \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all irreflexive frames.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nWe will now argue that no formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) defines the class of universal frames \\((W, R)\\), that is, frames in which \\(R\\) is universal on \\(W\\), that is, for all \\(w,u\\in W\\), \\(Rwu\\).\nFirst, a lemma:\n\nLemma 5.1 A formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) is valid in all universal frames \\((W,R)\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\) in which \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\).\n\n\nProof. Given a formula \\(\\varphi\\), we look at each direction in turn:\n\nIf \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\), then \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all universal frames \\((W,R)\\).\nThe contrapositive of this conditional is an immediate consequence of the observation that a universal relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\) is reflexive and euclidean on \\(W\\). So, if \\(R\\) is universal on \\(W\\), then \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). But then, if \\((W, R, V)\\nVdash \\varphi\\) where \\(R\\) is the universal relation on \\(W\\), then \\((W, R, V)\\nVdash \\varphi\\) where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\).\nIf \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all universal frames \\((W,R)\\), then \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\).\nWe set out to show the contrapositive. That is, if \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all equivalence frames, then \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all universal frames. Suppose \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\), where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). We set out to find a model \\((W', R', V')\\) where \\(R'\\) is a universal relation on \\(W'\\) and \\((W', R', V') \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Since \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\), there is some \\(w\\in W\\) such that \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Now:\n\\(W' = \\{u\\in W: Rwu\\}\\)\n\\(R' = R \\cap (W' \\times W')\\)\n\\(V'(p) = V(p) \\cap W'\\)\nThat is, we let \\(W'\\) consist of the equivalence class corresponding to \\(w\\), \\([w]_R\\), and we let \\(R'\\) and \\(V'\\) be the restriction of \\(R\\) and \\(V\\) to that equivalence class.\nA simple induction over the complexity of formulas reveals that for every formula \\(\\varphi\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n(W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\varphi & \\text{iff} & (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\varphi\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nCorollary 5.1 No formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) modally defines the class of universal frames.\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all universal frames. Then by the former proposition, \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all equivalence frames \\((W, R)\\) where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). Since some of those frames are not universal frames, \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid only in universal frames.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nMuch of the interest of validity in the class of universal frames is that they seem particularly suited for the evaluation of modal formulas when the modal operator is interpreted in terms of metaphysical necessity. Since the logic of universal frames coincides with that of frames in which the accessibility relation is a relation of equivalence, we appear to have reason to accept the validity of substitution instances of each of the formulas we considered above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula\nCondition on \\(R\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{T}\\)\n\\(\\Box p \\to p\\)\nreflexive on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{B}\\)\n\\(p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\nsymmetric on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{4}\\)\n\\(\\Box p \\to \\Box \\Box p\\)\ntransitive on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{5}\\)\n\\(\\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\neuclidean on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\nYet, some have offered reason to resist this picture of metaphysical modality.\nRoderick Chisholm invites one to consider a ship built from one-hundred wooden planks with a tolerant essence in that the ship could have survived the replacement of one plank with a new one even if not the replacement of every plank with a new plank. That is, it is part of the essence of the ship that it can survive the replacement of a single plank whenever it exists.\nOne is now asked to consider a chain of possibilities, which starts with the original ship and where each possibility differs from the next just by the replacement of a single plank.\n\n\n\n\\(S\\)\n\\(S_1\\)\n\\(S_2\\)\n\\(S_3\\)\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\\(S_{100}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(@\\)\n\\(w_1\\)\n\\(w_2\\)\n\\(w_3\\)\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\\(w_{100}\\)\n\n\n\nThe paradox of tolerant essence arises when we combine what would otherwise seem reasonable thoughts:\n\nEach pair of successive possible worlds contain the same ship, since by hypothesis, the ship’s essence tolerates the replacement of one plank with a new one.\nBy the transitivity of identity, \\(S\\) is the same ship as each of the ships \\(S_n\\) in the series. So, if it is possible for the ship to survive the replacement of two planks, then it is possible for the ship to survive that of three planks, etc.\n\\(S\\) is not the same ship as \\(S_100\\) as they have no planks in common. It is not possible for the ship to survive the replacement of all planks.\n\nChisholm is inclined to reject the hypothesis that the ship has a tolerant essence: if it is essential to it to be made of the original planks, then there is no reason to even think that successive worlds in the series contain the same ship. One may alternatively attempt to blame vagueness for the problem. Maybe there comes a point at which it is indeterminate whether the original ship has survived the replacement of a given number of planks.\nBut the real problem is not due to vagueness. Sarah Jane Leslie proposes to consider an axe made from three parts: a blade, a shaft, and a handle, and to assume that the essence of the. axe is tolerant to the change of one of those three parts. We are now asked to consider a chain of just four worlds each containing an axe made from three parts, where each axe differs only by one part from an adjacent axe, and the original axe is contained in the first world. That is, the original axe is \\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_1 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_2 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(@\\)\n\\(w_1\\)\n\\(w_2\\)\n\\(w_3\\)\n\n\n\nThe paradox now arises when we note:\n\nEach pair of successive possible worlds contain the same axe, since by hypothesis, the axe’s essence tolerates one-part changes.\nBy the transitivity of identity, \\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\) is the same axe as \\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\). So, it is possible for the firts axe to be made of \\(B_2\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(H_2\\).\n\\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\) is not the same axe as \\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\) as they have none of their parts in common. So, it is not possible for the firts axe to be made of \\(B_2\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(H_2\\).\n\nVagueness appears to play no role in this formulation of the problem. Nathan Salmon has used the first formulation of the paradox in to argue against the validity of \\(4\\) when \\(\\Box\\) is read in terms of metaphysical modality. His thought is to deny that what is possible with respect to \\(w_2\\) is automatically possible with respect to \\(w_1\\). Consider the four propositions: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\np_1 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_1, S_1, H_1\\\\\np_2 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_1, H_1\\\\\np_3 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_2, H_1\\\\\np_4 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_2, H_2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] Then:\n\n\\(p_4\\) is true at \\(w_4\\)\n\\(p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_3\\)\n\\(p_2\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_2\\)\n\\(p_1\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_2\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond \\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_1\\)\n\nThere is no paradox, though we would have one if we accepted every substitution instance of the formula: \\[\\tag{4$^\\Diamond$}\n\\Diamond \\Diamond p \\to \\Diamond p\n\\] For we we would be in a position to hold \\(\\Diamond p_4\\) is true at \\(w_1\\), which would be paradoxical. As it turns out, however, (\\(4^\\Diamond\\)) is equivalent to (4) above.",

So, every theorem of \\(K\\) is valid in every frame.\n\nProposition 5.7 All substitution instances of axiom \\(\\textsf{K}\\) is valid in all frames. \\[\\tag{$\\textsf{K}$}\n\\Box(p \\to  q) \\to (\\Box p \\to \\Box q)\\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nProof. Consider a substitution instance of axiom \\(\\textsf{K}\\): \\[\n\\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\psi).\n\\] Let \\((W, R)\\) be a frame and let \\((W, R, V)\\) be a model based on that frame. We argue that \\((W,R,V) \\models \\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\psi)\\). To that end, let \\(w \\in W\\) and suppose that \\((W,R,V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi)\\) and \\((W,R,V), w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi\\). If \\(u\\in W\\) is such that \\(Rwu\\), then \\((W,R,V), u \\Vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi\\) and \\((W,R,V) \\Vdash \\varphi\\). Therefore, \\((W,R,V), u  \\Vdash  \\psi\\). Generalizing, we find \\((W,R,V), w \\Vdash \\Box \\psi\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nWhile it is a purely mechanical procedure to check whether a finite sequence of formulas is a proof in a given system, it may take some skill and experience to find one. There is no perfectly general recipe for this, but as a general piece of advice, it helps to spend some time considering the question of why the formula should be valid. Since proofs and theorems of \\(\\textsf{K}\\) track validity in all frames, the question of validity may on occasion guide us to a proof.\n\n5.3.1.1 Derived Rules of Inference\nOne important observation at this poins is that we are entitled to propositional inferences within the system. If two formulas are propositionally equivalent, then you should feel free to move from one to the other. Here is a formal justification of that fact.\n\nProposition 5.8 If \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\varphi_1, \\dots, \\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\varphi_n\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is derivable from \\(\\{\\varphi_1, \\dots, \\varphi\\}\\) in propositional logic, then \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\psi\\).\n\n\nProof.

are in a position to compare the deductive strength of different normal modal systems. In what follows, we aim to develop an overview of the landscape of normal modal systems for propositional modal logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\n\n\n\nA modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) extends another modal system \\(\\Delta\\), written \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\), if, and only if, every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\). Or, in other words, for every formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\), \\[\n\\text{If} \\ \\vdash_{\\Delta} \\varphi \\ \\text{then} \\ \\vdash_{\\Sigma} \\varphi\n\\] A modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) is a proper extension of \\(\\Delta\\), written \\(\\Delta \\sqsubset \\Sigma\\) if, and only if, \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) but \\(\\Sigma \\not \\sqsubseteq \\Delta\\).\n\n\nHere is a graphical representation of some of the relations in which eleven normal modal systems stand to. each other. Each edge connects a modal system with a proper extension located above in the diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandscape of normal modal systems\n\n\n\nThere are two main techniques we use in order to justify the diagram. To argue that a modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) extends a system \\(\\Delta\\), we argue that every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nProposition 5.16 \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) if \\(\\Sigma\\) proves every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\).\n\n\nProof. Since \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) share the same rules of inference, if every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\), then every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KD} \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KT}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{KT}} \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi\\). \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi & T[\\varphi/p] \\\\\n2 & & \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & T_\\Diamond[\\varphi/p]\\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & PL \\ 1, 2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nThere is a semantic counterpart to this observation. We will eventually observe that each normal modal system characterizes the set of validities in a certain class of frames. In fact, each node in the earlier diagram corresponds to a class of formulas valid in a specific class of frames:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses of frames\n\n\n\nWe will see that the normal modal systems \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) and \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) are sound and complete with respect to the class of reflexive and serial frames, respectively. That means that the theorems of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\)are exactly those formulas that are valid in all reflexive frames. And the theorems of $\\textsf{KD}$ are the formulas that are valid in all serial frames. Now:\n\nProposition 5.17 Every reflexive frame is serial.\n\nThat means that if a formula is valid in all serial frames, then it will be valid in all reflexive frames. The soundness and completeness theorems for \\(KD\\) and \\(KT\\) will deliver a semantic route to the conclusion that every theorem of \\(KD\\) is a theorem of \\(KT\\).\nOn the other hand, the fact that \\(T\\) defines the class of reflexive frames suggests a semantic argument for the conclusion that \\(KD\\) does not extend \\(KT\\).\n\nProposition 5.18 If every theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\) is valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then \\(\\Delta\\not \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) if not every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n\nProof. If an axiom \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\Delta\\) is not valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then \\(\\varphi\\) is not a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\). That means that not every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nSince the theorems of \\(KD\\) are valid in all serial frames, the observation that \\(\\Box p \\to p\\), which is an axiom of \\(KT\\), is not valid in some serial frames tells us that \\(KT\\) is a proper extension of \\(KD\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(KT \\not \\sqsubseteq KD\\)\nThis is because \\(\\Box p \\to p\\) is not valid in every serial frame. To that purpose, consider the model based on a serial frame depicted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\((W, R, V), w_1 \\nVdash \\Box p \\to p\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may similarly use the fact that axiom 4 is not valid in every reflexive and symmetric frame to establish that some theorems of \\(KB5\\) are not theorems of \\(KTB\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(KB5 \\not \\sqsubseteq KTB\\)\nThis is because \\(\\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\) is not valid in every reflexive and symmetric frame. To that purpose, consider the model based on a reflexive and symmetric frame depicted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\((W, R, V), w_1 \\nVdash \\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere should we locate \\(KB5\\) in the diagram? We now argue that \\(KB4\\) and \\(KB5\\) are mutual extensions of each other, which is the reason we do not have a further node for \\(KB5\\) in the diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(KB4 \\sqsubseteq KB5\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{KB5} \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & &  \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi & B[\\Box \\varphi/p]\\\\\n2 & & \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\varphi & 5_\\Diamond [\\varphi/p]\\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi & RK \\ 2 \\\\\n4 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi & PL 1, 3\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(KB5 \\sqsubseteq KB4\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{KB4} \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi & B[\\diamond \\varphi/p]\\\\\n2 & & \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & 4_\\Diamond[\\varphi/p] \\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi & RK \\ 2\\\\\n4 & & \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi & PL \\ 1, 3\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(KB4 = KB5\\)\nThis is an immediate consequence of the last two examples.",

    "text": "6.1 Canonical Models\nWe have explored a landscape of normal modal systems characterizing different classes of frames. We now outline a method for the justification of the fact that a normal modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) characterizes a class of frames \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) by which, we mean, as usual that for every modal formula \\(\\varphi\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\vdash_\\Sigma  \\varphi & \\text{if, and  only if,} & \\models_{\\mathcal{C}} \\varphi\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThat is, \\(\\Sigma\\) proves all (Completeness) and only (Soundness) formulas, which are valid in all frames in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). One direction (Soundness) requires one to verify that the axioms of \\(\\Sigma\\) are valid in all frames in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), and that the rules of inference of \\(\\Sigma\\) preserve validity in all frames in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\nWe will now focus on the other direction (Completeness), which we approach by contraposition: if \\(\\varphi\\) is not a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\), then \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). That is, we will build a special model based on a frame \\((W, R)\\) in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) in which the formula \\(\\varphi\\) fails. The model in question will be what is known as the canonical model for the system \\(\\Sigma\\), and the main task will often be to verify that the canonical model for \\(\\Sigma\\) is based on a frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\nFirst, some preliminary definitions.\nNotice that this is not quite how we defined derivability in propositional logic since we make no allowance for premises in a derivation. To allow for premises would lead to undesirable results in the presence of the rule of necessitation.\nWe will exploit the fact that \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets of modal formulas have a number of helpful features we record now.\nMaximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets satisfy helpful decomposition principles.\nWe will often make use of an alternative characterization of the relation just now introduced for a canonical model.\nWe will now exploit the features of maximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets of modal formulas to define the canonical model for a modal system \\(\\Sigma\\).\nThe interest of canonical models is that they are governed by the truth lemma according to which a world in the canonical model for \\(\\Sigma\\) verifies a modal formula \\(\\varphi\\) if, and only if, that very formula is a member of the world conceived as a maximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent set of modal formulas.\nThe justification for the truth lemma is an induction of the complexity of modal formulas.",

That is, if \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every frame, then \\(\\varphi\\) is a theorem of \\(\\textsf{K}\\).\n\n\nWe argue by contraposition. Suppose a modal formula \\(\\varphi\\) is not a theorem of \\(\\textsf{K}\\). Then its negation \\(\\neg  \\varphi\\) will be \\(\\textsf{K}\\)-consistent. That means that we may use Lindenbaum’s lemma to extend \\(\\{\\neg \\varphi\\}\\) to a maximal \\(\\textsf{K}\\)-consistent set \\(\\Gamma\\). Now, note that \\(\\Gamma\\) is one of the worlds of the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{K}\\), \\((W_\\textsf{K}, R_\\textsf{K}, V_\\textsf{K})\\), and, by the Truth Lemma, we know that \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) will be true at \\(\\Gamma\\) in the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{K}\\). Therefore, \\(\\varphi\\) fails at a world in the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{K}\\). We conclude that \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in every frame.\n\nThere are further completeness theorems for the normal modal systems in the landscape we have considered. One example is the observation, for example, that a modal formula \\(\\varphi\\) is a theorem of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) if \\(\\models_{\\text{ref}} \\varphi\\). That is, if a formula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every reflexive frame, then \\(\\varphi\\) is a theorem of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\).\nWe argue for the contrapositive.

We will argue that \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) is true at a world of the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\). That will mean that \\(\\varphi\\) is false at a world of the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\). Recall that we want to establish the completeness of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) with respect to the class of reflexive frames, which means that we should verify that \\(\\varphi\\) fails at some world of some reflexive model. Our observation that \\(\\varphi\\) fails at the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) will suffice to that purpose only if the canonical model for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) is reflexive.\nTo complete the proof, we must verify that the canonical frame for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) is reflexive: for all maximal \\(\\textsf{KT}\\)-consistent sets of modal formulas \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\Gamma R_{\\textsf{KT}} \\Gamma\\). That will establish that \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in every reflexive frame, e.g., \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in the canonical frame for \\(\\textsf{KT}\\), which is reflexive.\n\nTheorem 6.2 For each modal formulas \\(\\varphi\\), if \\(\\models_{\\text{ref}} \\varphi\\), then \\(\\vdash_\\textsf{KT} \\varphi\\).
