    "text": "1.1 How to Interpret the Formalism\nPropositional logic classifies propositions into main categories: true and false. Modal logic makes further distinctions between modes in which a proposition may be true or false: necessarily true, possibly true, necessarily false, possibly false. The formal framework of modal logic expands the language of propositional logic with a sentential operator, \\(\\Box\\), for one of those modes, necessity, and a dual operator, \\(\\Diamond\\), for another, possibility.\nThere are, however, other interpretations of the formalism.\nThese distinctions may play a crucial role in philosophical argumentation.\nHow should we interpret the formalism? We use truth tables to interpret the language of propositional logic because propositional connectives are truth-functional, e.g., the truth value of a conjunction is a function of the truth values of its conjuncts. The strategy does not seem to be available in the case of modal logic, since the modal operator \\(\\Box\\) is not truth-functional:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\varphi & \\Box \\varphi \\\\\n\\hline\nT  & ? \\\\\n\\hline\nF  &  F \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\varphi\\) is false, \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) will of course be false. But the truth of \\(\\varphi\\) leaves open whether \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is true or false, e.g., \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) will be true when \\(\\varphi\\) is a tautology but false when \\(\\varphi\\) is interpreted to make a contingent statement.\nOne may attempt to overcome this limitation with the help of a more fine-grained distinction between necessary and contingent truths, on the one hand, and necessary and contingent falsehoods, on the other. We may even reserve the letters \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) for contingent and necessary truths respectively, and we may similarly use \\(f\\) and \\(F\\) for contingent and necessary falsehoods respectively. This appears to suggests a truth table for each negation and \\(\\Box\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\varphi & \\neg \\varphi & \\Box \\varphi\\\\\n\\hline\nT  & F & T\\\\\n\\hline\nt  &  f & F\\\\\n\\hline\nF  & T & F\\\\\n\\hline\nf  &  t & F\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe problem remains that we cannot generalize the scheme to cover binary propositional connectives such as the material connective. Once we opt for the more fine-grained distinction between necessary and contingent truths and falsehoods, the truth value of the conditional ceases to be a function of the truth values of antecedent and consequent.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\to & T & t & F & f\\\\\n\\hline\nT  & T & t & F  &  f \\\\\n\\hline\nt  &  T & ? & F &  f\\\\\n\\hline\nF  & T & T & T & T \\\\\n\\hline\nf  &  T & t & t & ? \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are contingently true, \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) may be necessarily true, e.g., \\(p \\to p\\) if \\(p\\) is contingently true, or merely contingently true, e.g., \\(p\\to q\\) for suitable choices of contingent propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Likewise, when \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are contingently false, the conditional may be necessarily or contingently true.",

    "section": "1.2 Possible Worlds",
    "text": "1.2 Possible Worlds\nWe must look elsewhere for an interpretation of the formalism of propositional modal logic. One key observation at this point is that propositions differ not just with respect to whether they are true or false, they may differ with respect to the circumstances under which they are true or false. The propositions expressed by the statements ‘Los Angeles has over three million inhabitants’ and ‘Kilimanjaro rises to 5,895 meters’ are both true but there are possible circumstances under which one is true and the other is false.\nWe may think of possible worlds as complete specifications of a way the world might be, and we may ask whether a sentence is true at a possible world. That is, we may ask whether the possible world in question specifies circumstances under which the sentence is in fact true.\nOnce we take on board the thought that a sentence may be true when evaluated with respect to one possible world but not when evaluated with respect to another, we may ask what is for a possible world to be possible relative to another. The proposition that I’m a philosopher is true given how the world is, but there are possible circumstances under which I’m an engineer. We codify that as the thought that a world at which I’m an engineer is possible with respect to the world of evaluation. We will call a possible world is accessible from another world if the former is possible with respect to the latter.\nWe now have the basic ingredients for a possible world semantics for propositional modal logic. More formally, a model for the framework will consist of a collection of possible worlds \\(W\\), an accessibility relation \\(R\\) on the collection \\(W\\), and a valuation function, which specifies which propositions are true at what possible worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Possible Worlds Model\n\n\n\nHere is a depiction of a possible worlds model, which consists of a set \\(W\\) of four worlds and a binary relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\). The model verifies \\(p\\) at \\(w_3\\) and \\(w_4\\), and it verifies \\(q\\) at \\(w_2\\) and \\(w_4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA negation \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is false at that world.\nA material conditional \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) just in case \\(\\varphi\\) is false at \\(w\\) or \\(\\psi\\) is true at \\(w\\).\nA formula \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is true at every world \\(u\\) to which \\(w\\) is related.\nA formula \\(\\Diamond \\varphi\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is true at some world \\(u\\) to which \\(w\\) is related.\n\nConsider the premises and conclusion of the modal ontological argument:\n\n\\(p \\to \\Box p\\) is true in every world in the model.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\(\\Box (p \\to \\Box p)\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Diamond p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Box p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(\\Diamond \\Box p\\) is true at every world in the model.\n\\(p\\) is true at \\(w_3\\) and \\(w_4\\) but not at either \\(w_1\\) or \\(w_2\\).\n\nIt follows that \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) are each a world that verifies every premise of the argument but not its conclusion.\nIt will turn out that the validity of the argument for the existence of numbers turns on the structure of the accessibility relation. That is, the argument will be valid when we restrict attention to models in which the accessibility relation is either symmetric or models in which the accessibility relation is reflexive and euclidean.1",

(2+1)}{2}\\\\\n1 + 2+ 3 & = & 6 & = & \\frac{3 . (3+1)}{2}\\\\\n\\cdots & = & \\cdots & = & \\cdots \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIf the pattern is completely general, then we may conjecture that the sum of the first \\(100\\) positive integers to be \\(5050\\), which is \\(\\frac{100.(100 +1)}{2}\\).\nWe can use an induction on the positive integers to prove the generalization:\nFor every positive integer \\(n\\), \\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}.\n\\]\nHere the condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) is: \\[\n\\sum_{k = 1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nBy induction on the positive integers, it suffices to show two claims:\n\n\\(\\Phi(1)\\), \\[\n\\sum_{n = 1}^{1} = \\frac{1.(1+1)}{2}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\Phi(n)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nThat is, suppose:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} = \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}.\n\\]\nThen:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} & = & \\sum_{k=1}^{n} + (n+1)\\\\  & =  & \\frac{n.(n+1)}{2} + (n+1)\\\\\n& = & \\frac{n^2 + 3n +2}{2} \\\\\n& = &\\frac{(n+1).((n+1)+1)}{2}  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]So, we conclude that every positive integer \\(n\\) satisfies the condition.\n\n\nA word of caution. The principle of induction becomes all too powerful when it is misused. Here is an example of how a misapplication of mathematical induction can lead us astray. Let me give you some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Not to Use Induction\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\Phi(n)\\) be the condition on positive integers:\n\nIf \\(A\\) is a set of \\(n\\) students, then they all share a birthday.\n\nBy induction on the positive integers, it suffices to show two claims:\n\n\\(\\Phi(1)\\).\nBut of course, if \\(A\\) is a singleton, then there is just one birthday.\nIf \\(\\Phi(n)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nConsider the transition from \\(2\\) to \\(3\\). Suppose \\(A\\) contains three students \\(a, b, c\\). On the assumption that \\(\\Phi(2)\\), we know both that the members of every two-element subset of \\(A\\) share a birthday. In particular, \\(a, b\\) share a birthday and that \\(b, c\\) share a birthday. So, \\(a, b, c\\) must all share a birthday.\nWe may generalize the argument for other cases as well.\n\nIt would seem to follow that no matter what \\(n\\) may be, a set of \\(n\\) students must share a birthday. Therefore, all students must share a birthday.\nThe conclusion is false, but where exactly is the flaw in the argument?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Not to Use Induction\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\Phi(n)\\) be the following condition on natural numbers:\n\nif two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, then \\(|A|=|B|\\).\n\nThat is, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, then they are in one-to-one correspondence.\nWe proceed in two steps:\n\n\\(\\Phi(0)\\).\nSuppose two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have at most \\(0\\) elements. Then. \\(A =\\emptyset =B\\).\nIf \\(\\Phi(n)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\nSuppose \\(\\Phi(n)\\) and let now \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two sets with at most \\(n+1\\) elements. Now, consider the sets \\(A^-\\) and \\(B^-\\), which arise from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) by subtracting just one element \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from each set. By inductive hypothesis, since \\(A^-\\) and \\(B^-\\) have at most \\(n\\) elements, they are are in one-one correspondence. But if they are, so will be \\(A^- \\cup \\{a\\}\\) and \\(B^- \\cup \\{b\\}\\), which are none other than \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nIt would seem to follow that no two sets with \\(n\\) of fewer elements differ in cardinality, which would mean that no two finite sets differ in cardinality.\nThat gives us the absurd conclusion that all finite sets are in one-one correspondence.\nWhere exactly is the flaw in the argument? The problem lies in the assumption that no matter what set we are given, we may, if we like, take away one element, which is not the case with the empty set.\n\n\nWe will sometimes rely on alternative but equivalent forms of induction:\n\nProposition 2.7 (Complete Induction) Given a condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) on natural numbers, if\n\n\\(\\Phi(0)\\), and\nfor all \\(m \\leq n\\), if \\(\\Phi(m)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n+1)\\).\n\nthen for every natural number \\(n\\), \\(\\Phi(n)\\).\n\nEquivalently:\n\nProposition 2.8 (Complete Induction without a Base Case) Given a condition \\(\\Phi(n)\\) on natural numbers, if\n\nfor all \\(m &lt; n\\), \\(\\Phi(m)\\), then \\(\\Phi(n)\\),\n\nthen for every natural number \\(n\\), \\(\\Phi(n)\\).\n\nNotice that \\(\\Phi(0)\\) will be true if the conditional above holds, for it will be vacuously true that all natural numbers less than \\(0\\) satisfy the condition \\(\\Phi\\).\nWe will often define infinite sets by recursion, which is closely connected to induction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nWe define a set of factorial numbers by recursion on the natural numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{F} := 1 | (n+1).F(n)\n\\]\nHere is how to read that notation. We generate the factorial numbers by specifying\n\\[\nF(0) = 1\n\\]\nand by explaining how to move from \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+1)\\):\n\\[\nF(n+1) = (n+1). F(n)\n\\]\nThe factorial number \\(F(n)\\) is commonly written as \\(n!\\). So, a number is a factorial number if it is \\(F(0)\\), namely, \\(1\\), or if it can be reached by repeated application of the rule that takes one from \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+1)\\). That means that the set of factorial numbers include:\n\\[\n1 \\ 2 \\ 6 \\ 24 \\ \\cdots\n\\]\nIn other words, a number is factorial if and only if we may eventually reach that number by a finite number of application of the rules included in the definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nYou could define by recursion a set of formulas for a formal language. Suppose we start with a simple vocabulary, which consists of only three symbols:\n\\[\n@, \\#, \\%\n\\]\nWe could define a set of formulas for that language by means of the following recursion:\n\\[\n\\varphi ::= @ \\ | \\  \\% \\varphi \\ | \\ (\\varphi \\ \\#  \\ \\psi)\n\\]\nHere is how to read that notation now.\n\n\\(@\\) is a formula of the language\nif \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula of the language, then \\(\\% \\varphi\\) is a formula\nif \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas of the language, then \\((\\varphi \\ \\# \\ \\psi)\\) is a formula.\n\nThat means that the set of formulas of the language includes:\n\\[\n@, \\%@, \\%\\% @, \\dots, (@ \\ \\# \\ @), (@ \\ \\# \\% @), \\% (@ \\ \\# \\ @), \\dots\n\\]",

A derivation of a well-formed formula from a set of formulas will consist of a finite sequence of formulas each of whose members will either be an axiom or a premise or the output of an application of the rule of inference to prior members of the sequence.\nThere is one ingredient we will use for the specification of the infinite set of axioms. If \\(\\varphi\\) is a propositional formula whose propositional variables are \\(p_1, ..., p_n\\) and \\(\\psi_1\\), …, \\(\\psi_n\\) are propositional formulas, we write \\[\n\\varphi[\\psi_1/p_1, ..., \\psi_n/p_n]\n\\]\nfor the well-formed formula that results from \\(\\varphi\\) when each propositional variable \\(p_i\\) is substituted for the well-formed formula \\(\\psi_i\\). We will call \\(\\varphi[\\psi_1/p_1, ..., \\psi_n/p_n]\\) a substitution instance of \\(\\varphi\\).\nWe are now in a position to define the set of axioms of the system:\nWe will use a single rule of inference, which we call Modus Ponens (\\(\\textsf{MP}\\)).

Curiously, the axiom system is able to prove every logical truth, and, moreover, it allows one to prove a formula from a set of formulas if, and only if, the former is a logical consequence of the latter.\nBut before we establish these results, we set out to develop a library of subroutines, which will facilitate the discussion of the question of whether a given formula is derivable from a set of formulas.\nWe will rely on a very general result. First, some notational conventions.\nOne direction is simple:\nThe other direction is the deduction theorem, which requires a more involved justification:\nThe deduction theorem encodes a common method of proof in mathematics. To establish a conditional \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) in a mathematical context, you may simply adjoin \\(\\varphi\\) to your assumptions \\(\\Gamma\\) and set out to derive \\(\\psi\\) from them.

We begin with an enumeration of the formulas of propositional logic: \\[\n\\varphi_0, \\varphi_1, \\cdots, \\varphi_n, \\cdots\n\\] Given \\(\\Gamma\\) be a consistent set of formulas, we build a maximal consistent superset \\(\\Sigma\\) by the following recursion: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Sigma_0 &  = &  \\Gamma \\\\\n\\Sigma_{n+1} & = & \\begin{cases} \\Sigma_n, \\varphi_n & \\text{if consistent}\\\\ \\Sigma_n &  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n\\] We let \\[\n\\Sigma = \\bigcup_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Sigma_n.\n\\]We now argue that \\(\\Sigma\\) is a maximal consistent superset of \\(\\Gamma\\).\nWe proceed in several steps.\n\nProposition 5.3 \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq \\Sigma\\)\n\nThis is because \\(\\Gamma = \\Sigma_0\\) and \\(\\Sigma_0 \\subseteq \\Sigma\\).\n\nProposition 5.4 For each natural number \\(n\\), \\(\\Gamma_n\\) is consistent.\n\n\nProof. A simple induction on \\(n\\) suffices:\n\n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) is consistent on the assumption \\(\\Gamma\\) is consistent.\nIf \\(\\Sigma_n\\) is consistent, then \\(\\Sigma_{n+1}\\) is \\(\\Sigma_n, \\varphi_n\\) if consistent, or else \\(\\Sigma_n\\). Either way, \\(\\Sigma_{n+1}\\) is consistent.\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nProposition 5.5 For each natural number \\(n\\), for every \\(m &lt; n\\), \\(\\Sigma_m \\subseteq \\Sigma_n\\).\n\n\nProof. We argue by induction on \\(n\\):\n\n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) is vacuously a superset of any set that may precede it in the sequence. This is because nothing precedes \\(\\Sigma_0\\) in the sequence.\n\\(\\Sigma_{n+1}\\) is \\(\\Sigma_n, \\varphi_n\\) if consistent, or else \\(\\Sigma_n\\). Either way, since by inductive hypothesis, for every \\(m &lt; n\\) \\(\\Sigma_{m} \\subseteq \\Sigma_{n}\\) and \\(\\Sigma_n \\subseteq \\Sigma_{n+1}\\), we conclude that for every \\(m &lt; n\\) \\(\\Sigma_{m} \\subseteq \\Sigma_{n+1}\\).\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nProposition 5.6 For every finite subset \\(\\Delta \\subseteq \\Sigma\\), there is some natural number \\(n\\) such that \\(\\Delta \\subseteq \\Sigma_n\\).\n\n\nProof. If \\(\\Delta\\) is a finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\), then let \\(\\varphi_n\\) be the member of \\(\\Delta\\) of highest index. That is for all \\(m\\), if \\(\\varphi_m \\in \\Delta\\), then \\(m \\leq n\\). Notice that for each natural number \\(m\\), if \\(\\varphi_m \\in \\Sigma\\), then \\(\\varphi_m \\in \\Sigma_{m+1}\\). That is, a formula \\(\\varphi_m\\) is accepted into \\(\\Sigma\\) via \\(\\Sigma_{m+1}\\) if at all. So, it follows that \\(\\Delta \\subseteq \\Sigma_{n+1}\\) if \\(n\\) is the highest index of a formula in \\(\\Delta\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nIt follows from the above that every finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent. We now argue that \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent as well.\n\nProposition 5.7 \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent.\n\n\nProof. For purposes of a reductio, suppose \\(\\Sigma \\vdash \\bot\\). That means that there is a finite derivation \\((\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_n)\\) of \\(\\bot\\) from \\(\\Sigma\\). It follows that there is a derivation of \\(\\bot\\) from a finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\), which would require that finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\) to be inconsistent. That contradicts the observation that every finite subset of \\(\\Sigma\\) is consistent.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nProposition 5.8 Given a formula \\(\\varphi\\), if \\(\\Sigma, \\varphi\\) is consistent, then \\(\\varphi \\in \\Sigma\\).\n\n\nProof. A formula \\(\\varphi\\) will be assigned an index by the enumeration, which means \\(\\varphi = \\varphi_n\\). Now, if \\(\\Sigma, \\varphi_n\\) is consistent, then \\(\\Sigma_n, \\varphi_n\\) will be consistent as well. But that means that by construction of \\(\\Sigma\\), \\(\\varphi_n \\in \\Sigma_{n+1} \\subseteq \\Sigma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nWe conclude that \\(\\Sigma\\) is a maximal consistent superset of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\nIt remains to show that a maximal consistent set of formulas is satisfiable.\n\nLemma 5.2 (Henkin Lemma) Every maximal consistent set \\(\\Sigma\\) is satisfiable.\n\n\nProof. Given a maximal consistent set \\(\\Sigma\\), let \\(V\\) based on an assignment \\(v\\) defined: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nv(p_n) = 1 & \\text{iff} & p_n \\in \\Sigma.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWe use an induction on the complexity of \\(\\varphi\\) to establish:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nV(\\varphi) = 1 & \\text{iff} & \\varphi \\in \\Sigma.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- Base Case:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\nV(p_n) = 1 & \\text{iff} & v(p_n) = 1 & \\\\\n   & \\text{iff} & p_n \\in \\Sigma. & \\textsf{Def} \\ v\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- Inductive Step for \\(\\neg\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\nV(\\neg \\varphi) = 1 & \\text{iff} & V(\\varphi) = 0 & \\\\\n    & \\text{iff} & \\varphi \\notin \\Sigma & \\textsf{IH} \\\\\n     & \\text{iff} & \\neg \\varphi \\in \\Sigma & \\textsf{Prop} \\ 3.8, 2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- Inductive Step for \\(\\to\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\nV(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = 1 & \\text{iff} & V(\\varphi) = 0 \\ \\text{or} \\ V(\\psi) =1 & \\\\\n    & \\text{iff} & \\varphi \\notin \\Sigma \\ \\text{or} \\ \\psi \\in \\Sigma& \\textsf{IH} \\\\\n     & \\text{iff} & \\varphi \\to \\psi \\in \\Sigma & \\textsf{Prop} \\ 3.8, 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWe conclude that \\(V\\) verifies exactly those formulas in \\(\\Sigma\\). So, it follows that \\(\\Sigma\\) is satisfiable.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nThis concludes the proof of completeness. From now on, we are entitled to assume that the axiom system proves every tautology and that if proves \\(\\varphi\\) from \\(\\Gamma\\) whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a logical consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\). These are facts we will use when we introduce suitable axiom systems for different modal logics.",

The accessibility relation represents a relation of relative possibility: \\(v\\) is accessible from \\(u\\) corresponds to the claim that \\(v\\) is possible relative to \\(u\\).\n\\(V\\) maps a propositional variable \\(p\\) to a set of worlds \\(w\\) at which \\(p\\) is true. So, when \\(w \\in V(p)\\), we will write that \\(p\\) is true at \\(w\\).\n\n\nOne way to think of the assignment \\(V\\) is as a specification of the set of worlds at which each propositional variable is true.\nWe will use directed graphs to represent possible worlds models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use a Graph to Represent a Possible Worlds Model\n\n\n\nHere is a depiction of a possible worlds model of the form \\((W, R, V)\\) where:\n\n\\(W = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4\\}\\)\n\\(R = \\{(w_1, w_2), (w_2, w_3), (w_3, w_4), (w_1, w_4), (w_1, w_3), (w_2, w_2)\\}\\)\n\\(V(p) = \\{w_3, w_4\\}\\); \\(V(q) = \\{w_2, w_4\\}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach node corresponds to a possible world in the model.\nThe accessibility relation relates one world to another when there is an arrow that points from the first to the second.\nThe graph records the propositional variables that are true at each world according to the assignment \\(V\\). If a propositional variable is not written at a node of the diagram, then the variable is not true at that world on the valuation depicted by the graph.\n\n\n\nWe do not have the means yet to ask whether a complex formula \\(\\varphi\\) is true at a world in a model. To that purpose, we provide a recursive definition of a semantic relation between a world \\(w\\) in a model \\(M\\) and a formula \\(\\varphi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth at a World\n\n\n\nWe define what is for a formula \\(\\varphi\\) to be true at a world \\(w\\) in a possible worlds model \\(M\\), which we write: \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nM, w \\Vdash p & \\text{iff} & w \\in V(p)\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi \\ \\text{or} \\ M, w \\Vdash \\psi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W \\ \\text{such that} \\ Rwu, \\ M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nGiven the usual defintion of \\(\\Diamond\\) in terms of \\(\\Box\\), we find that \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nM, w \\Vdash \\Diamond \\varphi & \\text{iff} & \\text{for some} \\ u \\in W \\ \\text{such that} \\ Rwu, \\ M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nWe may return to the example above to explain how to compute the truth value of a formula at a world in a model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nEvaluate each of the complex modal formulas given below at each possible world in the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p \\to (p \\to q)\\)\nThis formula is true at worlds \\(w_1\\), \\(w_2\\) \\(w_3\\) but not at \\(w_4\\).\n\n\\(M, w_4 \\nVdash p \\to (p \\to q)\\) because \\(M, w_4 \\Vdash p\\), yet \\(M, w_4 \\nVdash p \\to q\\).

One is the frame of the model, which consists of a set of worlds \\(W\\) and a relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\), and the other is the assignment \\(V\\) based on that frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame\n\n\n\nA frame \\(F\\) for \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) is an ordered pair \\((W, R)\\) where:\n\n\\(W\\) is a non-empty set of worlds, and\n\\(R\\) is a binary accessibility relation on \\(W\\)\n\nA model \\(M\\) is based on a frame \\(F = (W, R)\\) if, and only if, there is an assignment \\(V\\) such that \\(M = (F, V)\\). That is, \\(M = (W, R, V)\\).\n\n\nFor a formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) to be valid in a frame is to be true in every model based on that frame, that is, to be true at every world of every model based on that frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity\n\n\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in a frame \\((W, R)\\), written \\((W, R) \\models \\varphi\\), if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is true in every model \\((W, R, V)\\) based on the frame \\((W, R)\\).\nThat is, the formula remains true across assignments no matter what sets of worlds we assign to what propositional variables.\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid, written \\(\\models \\varphi\\), if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every frame \\((W, R)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nHere are two formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) that are valid in every frame:\n\n\\(\\Diamond (p \\vee q) \\leftrightarrow (\\Diamond p \\vee \\Diamond q)\\)\n\\(\\Box (p \\wedge q) \\leftrightarrow (\\Box p \\wedge \\Box q)\\)\n\nThe modal operators \\(\\Diamond\\) and \\(\\Box\\) distribute over disjunction and conjunction, respectively. These formulas are true at every world of every possible worlds model, which means that they are true in every model based on every frame.\nHere are, on the other hand, two formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) that are not valid in every frame:\n\n\\(\\Diamond (p \\wedge q) \\leftrightarrow (\\Diamond p \\wedge \\Diamond q)\\)\n\\(\\Box (p \\vee q) \\leftrightarrow (\\Box p \\vee \\Box q)\\)\n\nFor a counterexample to the validity of the first formula, consider the model below:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that \\(\\Diamond p \\wedge \\Diamond q\\) is true at \\(w_1\\) because each conjunct is true at \\(w_1\\):\n\n\\(\\Diamond p\\) is true at \\(w_1\\) because \\(p\\) is true at \\(w_2\\), which is accessible from \\(w_1\\)\n\\(\\Diamond q\\) is true at \\(w_1\\) because \\(q\\) is true at \\(w_3\\), which is accessible from \\(w_1\\)\n\nYet, \\(\\Diamond (p \\wedge q)\\) is false at \\(w_1\\) since \\(p \\wedge q\\) is not true at any world accessible from \\(w_1\\).\nThe model doubles as a counterexample to the validity of the second formula:\nNotice that \\(\\Box (p \\vee q)\\) is true at \\(w_1\\) because \\(p \\vee q\\) is true at every world accessible from \\(w_1\\):\n\n\\(p \\vee q\\) is true at \\(w_2\\) because \\(p\\) is true at \\(w_2\\).\n\\(p \\vee q\\) is true at \\(w_3\\) because \\(q\\) is true at \\(w_3\\).\n\nHowever, \\(\\Box p \\vee \\Box q\\) is not true at \\(w_1\\) because neither \\(\\Box p\\) nor \\(\\Box q\\) is true at \\(w_1\\).\n\n\\(\\Box p\\) is not true at \\(w_1\\) because \\(p\\) is not true at \\(w_3\\), which is accessible from \\(w_1\\).\n\\(\\Box q\\) is not true at \\(w_1\\) because \\(q\\) is not true at \\(w_2\\), which is accessible from \\(w_1\\).\n\n\n\n\nProposition 6.1 The formula \\(\\Box (p \\to q) \\to (\\Box p \\to \\Box q)\\) is valid in every frame.\n\n\nLet \\((W, R)\\) be a frame, and let \\((W, R, V)\\) be a model based on that frame. Let \\(w\\in W\\) be a world such that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box(p \\to q)\\). Suppose further that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box p\\).

Given \\(w \\in W\\), suppose \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box p\\), which means that for all \\(u\\in W\\), if \\(Rwu\\), then \\(u \\in V(p)\\). Since \\(R\\) is reflexive, \\(Rww\\) and \\(w \\in V(p)\\). So, \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box p\\) and \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box p \\to p\\).

Given \\(w \\in W\\), suppose \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash  p\\), which means that \\(w \\in V(p)\\). Let \\(u\\in W\\) be such that \\(Rwu\\). Since \\(R\\) is symmetric on \\(W\\), \\(Rwu\\), which means that \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash  \\Diamond p\\). Generalizing, for every \\(u\\in W\\), if \\(Rwu\\), \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash  \\Diamond p\\). We conclude that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash  \\Box \\Diamond p\\) and \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\). Generalizing again, we find \\((W, R, V) \\Vdash p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\).\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{4}\\) is valid in all transitive frames.\n\n\nLet \\((W, R, V)\\) be a model based on a transitive frame \\((W, R)\\). Given \\(w \\in W\\), suppose \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash  \\Box p\\), which means that for all \\(u\\in W\\), if \\(Rwu\\), then \\(u \\in V(p)\\). Let \\(u\\in W\\) be such that \\(Rwu\\). We want to verify that \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash  \\Box p\\). For let \\(t\\in W\\) be such that \\(Rut\\). Since \\(R\\) is transitive on \\(W\\), \\(Rwt\\), which means that \\(t\\in V(p)\\) and \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash  p\\). Generalizing, for every \\(t\\in W\\), if \\(Rut\\), \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash  p\\). We conclude that \\((W, R, V), u \\Vdash  \\Box p\\) and \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash  \\Box \\Box p\\).

The language affords us the means to distinguish reflexive from non-reflexive frames in terms of the validity of the formula \\(\\Box p \\to p\\). Likewise, we have the means to make distinctions between symmetric and non-symmetric frames or between transitive and non-transitive frames.\nFirst-order languages are able to make similar distinctions.

Even if the class of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive frames are each modal and first-order definable, one may wonder whether every class of formulas defined by a first-order formula is modally definable and, vice versa, whether every modally definable frame is first-order definable.\nThe answer to both questions is ‘no’. Some formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) are able to modally define classes of frames that are not first-order definable, and some classes of frames that are first-order definable are not modally definable by a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrames\nModal Definability\nFirst-Order Definability\n\n\n\n\nIrreflexive\nNo\n\\(\\forall x \\ \\neg Rxx\\)\n\n\nUniversal\nNo\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y Rxy\\)\n\n\nTransitive Converse Well-Founded\n\\(\\Box (\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\)\nNo\n\n\nIdentity\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (Rxy \\leftrightarrow x = y)\\)\n\n\nFunctional\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (Rxy \\wedge Rxz \\to x =y)\\)\n\n\nSerial\nYes\n\\(\\forall x \\exists y Rxy\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverse Well-Founded\n\n\n\nA binary relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(W\\) converse well-founded iff there are no infinite ascending \\(R\\)-chains of the form \\(x_1Rx_2 \\cdots x_nRx_{n+1} \\cdots\\).\n\n\n\nProposition 6.4 The class of transitive converse well-founded frames is not first-order definable.\n\nThis is a consequence of the Compactness Theorem for first-order logic: if a set of first-order formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) is finitely satisfiable, then \\(\\Gamma\\) is finitely satisfiable.\n\nProof. For each natural number \\(n &gt; 0\\), let \\(\\varphi_n\\) be a formula according to which there is a finite \\(R\\)-chain with at least \\(n+1\\) nodes:\n\\[\n\\varphi_n := \\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_{n+1} \\ (Rx_1x_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge Rx_n x_{n+1})\n\\]For every first-order formula \\(\\psi\\), if \\(\\psi\\) is true of every converse-well-founded frame, then if \\(\\Sigma\\) is a set of formulas that requires \\(R\\) to form a linear order, that is, be irreflexive, transitive, and connected, then \\[\n\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\varphi_n: n &gt; 0\\}, \\psi\n\\]is finitely satisfiable. If \\(\\Delta\\) is a finite subset of that set, then there is a largest \\(n\\) for which \\(\\varphi_n \\in \\Delta\\), and a frame \\((W,  R)\\) in which \\(R\\) is a linear order of exactly \\(n\\) worlds will satisfy \\(\\Delta\\).

So, \\(\\psi\\) is satisfiable in a non-converse-well-founded frame. So, if \\(\\psi\\) is true of every converse well-founded frame, then it is true of some non-converse-well-founded frames.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nProposition 6.5 \\(\\Box (\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\) modally defines the class of converse well-founded frames.\n\n\nProof.

Then there are worlds \\(w, u, v\\in W\\) such that \\(wRu\\) and \\(uRv\\) but not \\(wRv\\). In that case, let \\(V(p) = W \\setminus \\{u, v\\}\\) and note that \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\) and \\((W, R, V), u \\nVdash \\Box p\\). Furthermore, \\((W, R, V), u \\nVdash \\Box p \\to p\\). However, by definition of \\(V\\), if \\(Rwt\\), then either \\(t =u\\) or \\(t \\in V(p)\\). Either way, \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash p\\) and \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash \\Box p \\to p\\). So, \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\). So, \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\).\nNow, suppose \\(R\\) is not converse well-founded. Then there is an infinite \\(R\\)-chain \\(u_1 Ru_2 \\dots u_nRu_{n+1} \\dots\\). In that case, we efine \\(V(p)\\) to exclude every member of the \\(R\\)-chain, that is, \\(V(p) = W \\setminus \\{u_1, u_2, \\dots\\}\\). Given some \\(w \\in X\\), we argue that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\) even though \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\). For the former, note that \\((W, R, V), u_n \\nVdash \\Box p\\) for each member \\(u_n\\) of the infinite \\(R\\)-chain.

So, \\((W, R, V), u_n \\nVdash \\Box (\\Box p  \\to p) \\to \\Box p\\) for every member \\(u_n\\) of the infinite \\(R\\)-chain.\n(\\(\\Leftarrow\\)) Suppose \\(R\\) is transitive and converse well-founded. Furthermore, let \\((W, R, V)\\) be a model based on \\((W, R)\\) and let \\(w \\in W\\). We now argue that \\((W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\Box (\\Box p \\to p)\\to \\Box p\\). For suppose \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\) and consider the set \\(X=\\{u \\in W: wRu \\wedge u\\notin V(p) \\}\\). We know that this set is non-empty since \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\Box p\\). Since \\(R\\) is converse well-founded, there is some \\(v \\in X\\) such that \\(\\neg vRt\\) for any \\(t\\in X\\). Otherwise, we would have an infinite \\(R\\)-chain. Since \\(v\\in X\\), we have that \\((W, R, V), v \\nVdash p\\), despite the fact that if \\(vRt\\), by transitivity, \\(wRt\\) and since \\(t\\notin X\\), \\((W, R, V), t \\Vdash p\\). So, \\((W, R, V), v \\Vdash \\Box p\\) and \\((W, R, V), v \\nVdash \\Box p \\to p\\).

We then proceed to make sure that for each propositional variable \\(p\\), each duplicate \\(w^+\\) and \\(w^-\\) is a member of \\(V'(p)\\) if \\(w \\in V(p)\\) in the original model. Otherwise, \\(R'\\) and \\(V'\\) behave exactly like \\(R\\) and \\(V\\) in the original model.1\nIt is not difficult to verify that \\((W, R, V)\\) is bisimilar to \\((W', R', V')\\), which means that they verify exactly the same formulas. This is because the relation \\(E\\), which relates each reflexive world \\(w \\in W\\) with its duplicates \\(w^+\\) and \\(w^-\\) in \\(W'\\) and relates every other world \\(u\\in W\\) with itself is a bisimulation between the two models.\n\n\n\nProposition 6.7 (Modal Undefinability for Irreflexive Frames) No formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) modally defines the class of irreflexive frames.\n\n\nProof. No formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) is valid in all and only irreflexive frames. For suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is valid only in irreflexive frames. That means that if \\(R\\) is not irreflexive on \\(W\\), then there is some model \\((W, R, V)\\) based on \\((W, R)\\) such that \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Then, given our previous observation, there is a bisimilar irreflexive model \\((W', R', V')\\) where \\((W', R', V') \\nVdash \\varphi\\). But notice that since \\((W', R', V')\\) is based on an irreflexive frame \\((W', R')\\), we conclude that \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all irreflexive frames.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nWe will now argue that no formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) defines the class of universal frames \\((W, R)\\), that is, frames in which \\(R\\) is universal on \\(W\\), that is, for all \\(w,u\\in W\\), \\(Rwu\\).\nFirst, a lemma:\n\nLemma 6.1 A formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) is valid in all universal frames \\((W,R)\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\) in which \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\).\n\n\nProof. Given a formula \\(\\varphi\\), we look at each direction in turn:\n\nIf \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\), then \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all universal frames \\((W,R)\\).\nThe contrapositive of this conditional is an immediate consequence of the observation that a universal relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\) is reflexive and euclidean on \\(W\\). So, if \\(R\\) is universal on \\(W\\), then \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). But then, if \\((W, R, V)\\nVdash \\varphi\\) where \\(R\\) is the universal relation on \\(W\\), then \\((W, R, V)\\nVdash \\varphi\\) where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\).\nIf \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all universal frames \\((W,R)\\), then \\((W, R)\\models \\varphi\\) for all equivalence frames \\((W,R)\\).\nWe set out to show the contrapositive. That is, if \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all equivalence frames, then \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid in all universal frames. Suppose \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\), where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). We set out to find a model \\((W', R', V')\\) where \\(R'\\) is a universal relation on \\(W'\\) and \\((W', R', V') \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Since \\((W, R, V) \\nVdash \\varphi\\), there is some \\(w\\in W\\) such that \\((W, R, V), w \\nVdash \\varphi\\). Now:\n\\(W' = \\{u\\in W: Rwu\\}\\)\n\\(R' = R \\cap (W' \\times W')\\)\n\\(V'(p) = V(p) \\cap W'\\)\nThat is, we let \\(W'\\) consist of the equivalence class corresponding to \\(w\\), \\([w]_R\\), and we let \\(R'\\) and \\(V'\\) be the restriction of \\(R\\) and \\(V\\) to that equivalence class.\nA simple induction over the complexity of formulas reveals that for every formula \\(\\varphi\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n(W, R, V), w \\Vdash \\varphi & \\text{iff} & (W', R', V'), w' \\Vdash \\varphi\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nCorollary 6.1 No formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) modally defines the class of universal frames.\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all universal frames. Then by the former proposition, \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in all equivalence frames \\((W, R)\\) where \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(W\\). Since some of those frames are not universal frames, \\(\\varphi\\) is not valid only in universal frames.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nMuch of the interest of validity in the class of universal frames is that they seem particularly suited for the evaluation of modal formulas when the modal operator is interpreted in terms of metaphysical necessity. Since the logic of universal frames coincides with that of frames in which the accessibility relation is a relation of equivalence, we appear to have reason to accept the validity of substitution instances of each of the formulas we considered above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula\nCondition on \\(R\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{T}\\)\n\\(\\Box p \\to p\\)\nreflexive on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{B}\\)\n\\(p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\nsymmetric on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{4}\\)\n\\(\\Box p \\to \\Box \\Box p\\)\ntransitive on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{5}\\)\n\\(\\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\neuclidean on \\(W\\)\n\n\n\nYet, some have offered reason to resist this picture of metaphysical modality.\nIn (Chisholm 1967) and (Chisholm 1973), Roderick Chisholm invites one to consider a ship built from one-hundred wooden planks with a tolerant essence in that the ship could have survived the replacement of one plank with a new one even if not the replacement of every plank with a new plank. That is, it is part of the essence of the ship that it can survive the replacement of a single plank whenever it exists.\nOne is now asked to consider a chain of possibilities, which starts with the original ship and where each possibility differs from the next just by the replacement of a single plank.\n\n\n\n\\(S\\)\n\\(S_1\\)\n\\(S_2\\)\n\\(S_3\\)\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\\(S_{100}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(@\\)\n\\(w_1\\)\n\\(w_2\\)\n\\(w_3\\)\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\\(w_{100}\\)\n\n\n\nThe paradox of tolerant essence arises when we combine what would otherwise seem reasonable thoughts:\n\nEach pair of successive possible worlds contain the same ship, since by hypothesis, the ship’s essence tolerates the replacement of one plank with a new one.\nBy the transitivity of identity, \\(S\\) is the same ship as each of the ships \\(S_n\\) in the series. So, if it is possible for the ship to survive the replacement of two planks, then it is possible for the ship to survive that of three planks, etc.\n\\(S\\) is not the same ship as \\(S_100\\) as they have no planks in common. It is not possible for the ship to survive the replacement of all planks.\n\nChisholm is inclined to reject the hypothesis that the ship has a tolerant essence: if it is essential to it to be made of the original planks, then there is no reason to even think that successive worlds in the series contain the same ship. One may alternatively attempt to blame vagueness for the problem. Maybe there comes a point at which it is indeterminate whether the original ship has survived the replacement of a given number of planks.\nBut the real problem is not due to vagueness. In (Leslie 2011), Sarah Jane Leslie proposes to consider an axe made from three parts: a blade, a shaft, and a handle, and to assume that the essence of the. axe is tolerant to the change of one of those three parts. We are now asked to consider a chain of just four worlds each containing an axe made from three parts, where each axe differs only by one part from an adjacent axe, and the original axe is contained in the first world. That is, the original axe is \\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_1 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_2 + H_1\\)\n\\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(@\\)\n\\(w_1\\)\n\\(w_2\\)\n\\(w_3\\)\n\n\n\nThe paradox now arises when we note:\n\nEach pair of successive possible worlds contain the same axe, since by hypothesis, the axe’s essence tolerates one-part changes.\nBy the transitivity of identity, \\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\) is the same axe as \\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\). So, it is possible for the firts axe to be made of \\(B_2\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(H_2\\).\n\\(B_1 + S_1 + H_1\\) is not the same axe as \\(B_2 + S_2 + H_2\\) as they have none of their parts in common. So, it is not possible for the firts axe to be made of \\(B_2\\), \\(S_2\\), and \\(H_2\\).\n\nVagueness appears to play no role in this formulation of the problem. Nathan Salmon has used the first formulation of the paradox in (Salmon 1989) to argue against the validity of \\(4\\) when \\(\\Box\\) is read in terms of metaphysical modality. His thought is to deny that what is possible with respect to \\(w_2\\) is automatically possible with respect to \\(w_1\\). Consider the four propositions: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\np_1 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_1, S_1, H_1\\\\\np_2 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_1, H_1\\\\\np_3 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_2, H_1\\\\\np_4 & & \\text{Axe is made from} \\ B_2, S_2, H_2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] Then:\n\n\\(p_4\\) is true at \\(w_4\\)\n\\(p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_3\\)\n\\(p_2\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_2\\)\n\\(p_1\\) and \\(\\Diamond p_2\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond p_3\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\Diamond \\Diamond p_4\\) are true at \\(w_1\\)\n\nThere is no paradox, though we would have one if we accepted every substitution instance of the formula: \\[\\tag{4$^\\Diamond$}\n\\Diamond \\Diamond p \\to \\Diamond p\n\\] For we we would be in a position to hold \\(\\Diamond p_4\\) is true at \\(w_1\\), which would be paradoxical. As it turns out, however, (\\(4^\\Diamond\\)) is equivalent to (4) above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChisholm, Roderick M. 1967. “Identity Through Possible Worlds: Some Questions.” Noûs, 1–8.\n\n\n———. 1973. “Parts as Essential to Their Wholes.” The Review of Metaphysics 26 (4): 581–603.\n\n\nLeslie, Sarah-Jane. 2011. “Essence, Plenitude, and Paradox.” Philosophical Perspectives 25: 277–96.\n\n\nSalmon, Nathan. 1989. “The Logic of What Might Have Been.” The Philosophical Review 98 (1): 3–34.",

If two formulas are propositionally equivalent, then you should feel free to move from one to the other. Here is a formal justification of that fact.\n\nTheorem 7.2 If \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\varphi_1, \\dots, \\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\varphi_n\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is derivable from \\(\\{\\varphi_1, \\dots, \\varphi\\}\\) in propositional logic, then \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\psi\\).\n\n\nProof. Given the Deduction Theorem for Propositional Logic, if \\(\\psi\\) is derivable from \\(\\{\\varphi_1, \\dots, \\varphi\\}\\) in propositional logic, then \\(\\varphi_1 \\to (\\varphi_2 \\to (\\dots (\\varphi_n \\to \\psi)\\dots))\\) is a theorem of propositional logic and thus a theorem of \\(K\\). By repeated applications of Modus Ponens, we infer \\(\\vdash_\\textsf{K} \\psi\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nWe are similarly able to justify derived rules of inference, which will help us take a more direct route between two steps in a proof.\n\nTheorem 7.3 If \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\varphi \\to \\psi\\), then \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\psi\\).\n\n\nProof.

In what follows, we aim to develop an overview of the landscape of normal modal systems for propositional modal logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\n\n\n\nA modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) extends another modal system \\(\\Delta\\), written \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\), if, and only if, every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\). Or, in other words, for every formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\), \\[\n\\text{If} \\ \\vdash_{\\Delta} \\varphi \\ \\text{then} \\ \\vdash_{\\Sigma} \\varphi\n\\] A modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) is a proper extension of \\(\\Delta\\), written \\(\\Delta \\sqsubset \\Sigma\\) if, and only if, \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) but \\(\\Sigma \\not \\sqsubseteq \\Delta\\).\n\n\nHere is a graphical representation of some of the relations in which eleven normal modal systems stand to. each other. Each edge connects a modal system with a proper extension located above in the diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main techniques we use in order to justify the diagram. To argue that a modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) extends a system \\(\\Delta\\), we argue that every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nProposition 7.8 \\(\\Delta \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) if \\(\\Sigma\\) proves every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\).\n\n\nProof. Since \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) share the same rules of inference, if every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\), then every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KD} \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KT}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{KT}} \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi\\). \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi & T[\\varphi/p] \\\\\n2 & & \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & T_\\Diamond[\\varphi/p]\\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & PL \\ 1, 2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is a semantic counterpart to this observation. We will eventually observe that each normal modal system characterizes the set of validities in a certain class of frames. In fact, each node in the earlier diagram corresponds to a class of formulas valid in a specific class of frames:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundness\n\n\n\nA modal system \\(\\Sigma\\) is sound with respect to a class of frames \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) if, and only if, for every formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\), \\(\\vdash_{\\Sigma} \\varphi\\) only if \\(\\models_{\\mathcal{C}} \\varphi\\).\n\n\nWe will see that the normal modal systems \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) and \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) are sound and complete with respect to the class of reflexive and serial frames, respectively. That means that the theorems of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) are exactly those formulas that are valid in all reflexive frames. And the theorems of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) are the formulas that are valid in all serial frames. Now:\n\nProposition 7.9 Every reflexive frame is serial.\n\nThat means that if a formula is valid in all serial frames, then it will be valid in all reflexive frames. The soundness and completeness theorems for \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) and \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) will deliver a semantic route to the conclusion that every theorem of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) is a theorem of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) .\nOn the other hand, the fact that \\(\\textsf{T}\\) defines the class of reflexive frames suggests a semantic argument for the conclusion that \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) does not extend \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) .\n\nProposition 7.10 If every theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\) is valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then \\(\\Delta\\not \\sqsubseteq \\Sigma\\) if not every axiom of \\(\\Delta\\) is valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n\nProof. If an axiom \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\Delta\\) is not valid in every frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then \\(\\varphi\\) is not a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\). That means that not every theorem of \\(\\Delta\\) is a theorem of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nSince the theorems of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) are valid in all serial frames, the observation that \\(\\Box p \\to p\\), which is an axiom of \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) , is not valid in some serial frames tells us that \\(\\textsf{KT}\\) is a proper extension of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KT} \\not \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KD}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\Box p \\to p\\) is not valid in every serial frame. To that purpose, consider the model based on a serial frame depicted below.\n\\((W, R, V), w_1 \\nVdash \\Box p \\to p\\)\n\n\nWe may similarly use the fact that axiom 4 is not valid in every reflexive and symmetric frame to establish that some theorems of \\(\\textsf{KB5}\\) are not theorems of \\(\\textsf{KTB}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KB5} \\not \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KTB}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\) is not valid in every reflexive and symmetric frame. To that purpose, consider the model based on a reflexive and symmetric frame depicted below.\n\\((W, R, V), w_1 \\nVdash \\Diamond p \\to \\Box \\Diamond p\\)\n\n\nWhere should we locate \\(\\textsf{KB5}\\) in the diagram? We now argue that \\(\\textsf{KB4}\\) and \\(\\textsf{KB5}\\) are mutual extensions of each other, which is the reason we do not have a further node for \\(\\textsf{KB5}\\) in the diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KB4} \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KB5}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{KB5}} \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & &  \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi & \\textsf{B}[\\Box \\varphi/p]\\\\\n2 & & \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\varphi & \\textsf{5}_\\Diamond [\\varphi/p]\\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\Diamond \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi & \\textsf{RK} \\ 2 \\\\\n4 & & \\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Box \\varphi & \\textsf{PL} 1, 3\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KB5} \\sqsubseteq \\textsf{KB4}\\)\nThis is because \\(\\vdash_{\\textsf{KB4}} \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi & \\textsf{B}[\\diamond \\varphi/p]\\\\\n2 & & \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\varphi & \\textsf{4}_\\Diamond[\\varphi/p] \\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\Diamond \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi & \\textsf{RK} \\ 2\\\\\n4 & & \\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi & \\textsf{PL} \\ 1, 3\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\textsf{KB4} = \\textsf{KB5}\\)\nThis is an immediate consequence of the last two examples.",

That is, we will build a special model based on a frame \\((W, R)\\) in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) in which the formula \\(\\varphi\\) fails. The model in question will be what is known as the canonical model for the system \\(\\Sigma\\), and the main task will often be to verify that the canonical model for \\(\\Sigma\\) is based on a frame in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\nFirst, some preliminary definitions.\nWe will exploit the fact that \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets of modal formulas have a number of helpful features we record now.\nMaximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets satisfy helpful decomposition principles.\nWe will often make use of an alternative characterization of the relation just now introduced for a canonical model.\nWe will now exploit the features of maximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent sets of modal formulas to define the canonical model for a modal system \\(\\Sigma\\).\nThe interest of canonical models is that they are governed by the truth lemma according to which a world in the canonical model for \\(\\Sigma\\) verifies a modal formula \\(\\varphi\\) if, and only if, that very formula is a member of the world conceived as a maximal \\(\\Sigma\\)-consistent set of modal formulas.\nThe justification for the truth lemma is an induction of the complexity of modal formulas.",

    "text": "10.1 Branching Time\nWe will now pause to consider the interaction between time and necessity. It is not uncommon to take past and future to enjoy a different status. The past is fixed, unalterable, and closed. The future, on the other hand, is open.\nSome have argued that there is no such asymmetry between past and future. If you insist that the past is closed, then you will have to grant that the future is similarly closed. This is supposed to be the lesson of a variety of ancient arguments from the Stoics to Aristotle to Ockham.\nThe challenge is to make sense of the asymmetry between past and future. One way to model a state of affairs in which the past is closed but the future is open is by means of a tree:\nThere are, for each moment of time, many different ways forward through the tree but only one way back. A moment of time is a member of several paths, which correspond to alternative histories. Each such history determines a possible future for the given time. Suppose the present moment of time is \\(t_0\\), and that a sea battle takes place at a time found in \\(h_1\\) but not at a time found in \\(h_2\\). For example, there is a sea battle at \\(t_1\\), but there is no sea battle to be found at a time in \\(h_2\\). Then, at \\(t_0\\), it is open whether there will be a sea battle once in the future. There will be one if \\(t_1\\) turns out to be a future time with respect to \\(t_0\\), but none if every future time turns out to lie within \\(h_2\\).\nA history is a complete path through a tree.\nThe question of whether \\(\\textsf{F}p\\) is true at a time \\(t\\) now depends on how the future turns out to be, which is settled differently by each history through \\(t\\). So, truth will be relative to ordered pairs of moments and histories. That is, a valuation \\(V\\) will map an atom like \\(p\\) to a set of ordered pairs of the form \\((t, h)\\), where \\(t\\) is a member of \\(h\\) and \\(h\\) is a history through \\(t\\). We will generally write \\((t, h)\\) as \\(t/h\\) for short.\nWe may now define truth at a pair \\(t/h\\) in a branching time model:\nWe are now in a position to interpret the necessity operator \\(\\Box\\) as follows: \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is true at \\(t/h\\) just in case \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t/k\\) for every history \\(k\\) through \\(t\\). In other words, \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t/h\\) no matter how the future turns out to be; \\(\\Diamond \\varphi\\), on the other hand, is true at \\(t/h\\) if there is a way the future may turn out to be on which \\(\\varphi\\) is true.\nConsider a tree frame \\((T, &lt;)\\). If \\((T, &lt;, V), t/h \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi\\), then for all \\(k \\in H_t\\), \\((T, &lt;, V), t/k \\Vdash \\varphi\\). But since \\(h\\) itself is a history that contains \\(t\\), \\((T, &lt;, V), t/k \\Vdash \\varphi\\).\nOn the other hand, if \\((T, &lt;, V), t/h \\Vdash \\Diamond \\varphi\\), then for some \\(k \\in H_t\\), \\((T, &lt;, V), t/k \\Vdash \\varphi\\). But now, if \\(l \\in H_t\\), then \\((T, &lt;, V), t/l \\Vdash \\Diamond \\varphi\\). So, \\((T, &lt;, V), t/h \\Vdash \\Box \\Diamond \\varphi\\).\nOn the other hand, we do not generally have:\n\\[\n\\textsf{P}\\Diamond \\varphi \\to \\Diamond \\textsf{P} \\varphi\n\\]\nFor suppose it had been possible that there would be a sea battle once in the past. It does not follow that it is possible that a sea battle occurred in the past. That if no sea battle ever took place, then even if a sea battle could have been the case once in the past, it is now not open that a sea battle took place once in the past. From the mere fact that a path was open once in the past, it does not follow that the path remains open now.\nTo return to the sea battle argument, we find \\(\\textsf{H} \\varphi \\to \\Box \\textsf{H}\\varphi\\) — but not \\(\\textsf{G} \\varphi \\to \\Box \\textsf{G} \\varphi\\) — is valid in every tree.\nOn the other hand, it is not difficult to falsify \\(\\textsf{G} \\varphi \\to \\Box \\textsf{G} \\varphi\\) in a tree frame. The reason is simple. Even if \\(\\textsf{G}\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t/h\\) in virtue of the fact that \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(u/h\\) for some later \\(u \\in H\\), there is no guarantee that \\(\\varphi\\) will be true at later times \\(u\\) of an alternative history \\(k\\) of which \\(t\\) is a member. So, there is no reason to expect \\(\\textsf{G}\\varphi\\) to be true at every pair of the form \\(t/k\\) with \\(t \\in k\\).",

For each agent \\(i\\), we introduce the operator \\(\\textsf{stit}_i \\varphi\\), read: “agent \\(i\\) sees to it that \\(\\varphi\\).” The fact that \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t/h\\) is guaranteed by some prior choice made by the agent \\(i\\).\nThe basic thought is that at a given time an individual agent can make choices which rule out at least some potential futures. That is, when \\(i\\) carries out an action at a pair \\(t/h\\), \\(i\\) is able to rule out some histories through \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice Function\n\n\n\nGiven a tree \\((T, &lt;)\\), a choice function \\(C\\) maps each agent \\(i\\) and time \\(t\\) in \\(T\\) into a partition \\(C^t_i\\) of the set of histories \\(H_t\\) through \\(t\\).\nAn equivalence class in \\(C^t_i\\) is called a choice cell. If two histories \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) in \\(H_t\\) belong in \\(C^t_i\\), then they will agree up to the time \\(t\\) but perhaps not at times later than \\(t\\).\nGiven a history \\(h\\), \\(C^t_i(h)\\) is the choice cell to which \\(h\\) belongs. Since \\(C^t_i\\) partitions the domain into a number of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive equivalence classes, each history will belong to exactly one such choice cell.\n\n\nThe choice function \\(C^t_i\\) encodes the actions open to the agent \\(i\\) at \\(t\\), and to think of each choice cell or equivalence class generated by \\(C^t_i\\) as an action open to \\(i\\) at \\(t\\).

    "text": "11.1 The Logic of Obligation\nThe language of deontic logic \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\textsf{O}}\\) supplements the language of propositional logic with a propositional operator, \\(\\textsf{O}\\varphi\\), read: “it ought to be the case that \\(\\varphi\\)”. Its dual, \\(\\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg \\varphi\\) is symbolized: \\(\\textsf{P}\\) and read: “it is permissible that \\(\\varphi\\).” There are different interpretations of \\(\\textsf{O}\\) in line with different types of obligation, which may include prudential, legal, and moral obligation.\nWe may still use possible worlds models to interpret the language, but we will use a different heuristic. Given a frame \\((W, R)\\), we conceive of each member of \\(W\\) as a possible world. We now gloss the accessibility relation \\(R\\) in terms of the system of norms in force at each world. Of course the relevant system of norms will depend on the type of obligation we use to interpret the modal operator \\(\\textsf{O}\\). Given a world \\(w \\in W\\), we say that \\(u\\) is accessible from \\(w\\), \\(Rwu\\), if, and only if, \\(w\\) is admissible relative to the system norms in force at \\(w\\). That is, whatever ought to be case according to the system of norms in force at \\(w\\) is indeed the case at \\(u\\). In that respect, \\(u\\) involves no more, and perhaps less, of a departure from what is required by system of norms in force at \\(w\\) than \\(u\\) does.\nNotice that the fact that \\(Rwu\\) is not to say that whatever ought to be the case according to the system of norms at \\(u\\) is the case at \\(u\\). For the norms that are in force at \\(u\\) may be more restrictive than those in place at \\(w\\).\nThe use of possible worlds models to interpret the language of deontic logic is not inconsequential. For the model theory vindicates a rule of necessitation, and it validates all substitution instances of axiom \\(\\textsf{K}\\):\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{N}$}\n\\varphi / \\textsf{O} \\varphi\n\\]\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{K}$}\n\\textsf{O}(p \\to q) \\to (\\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}q)\n\\]\nBut one may reasonably question either constraint. For it is difficult to find a sense in which a logical truth should be obligatory or, if you like, the content of a requirement or obligation. You may be tempted to read \\(\\textsf{O} \\varphi\\) in terms of entailment from what is required by a system of norms. Since anything entails a logical truth, it is to be expected that they follow from whatever is required by whatever norms may be in force.\nWe know that \\(\\textsf{K}\\) is sound and complete with respect to the class of all frames, but the question now is whether we should supplemented it with further axioms for obligation. Standard Deontic Logic supplements the axioms of \\(\\textsf{K}\\) with all substitution instances of the axiom:\n\\[ \\tag{$\\textsf{D}$}\n\\textsf{O}p \\to \\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg p\n\\]\nSince \\(\\textsf{P}p\\) abbreviates: \\(\\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg p\\), standard deontic logic amounts to the normal modal logic \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\textsf{O}\\). Axiom \\(\\textsf{D}\\) encodes the presupposition that something is obligatory only if it is permissible and modally defines the seriality condition on accessibility: no matter what world \\(w\\) may be, some world \\(u\\) must be accessible from \\(w\\).\nMore controversial are the deontic counterparts of axioms \\(\\textsf{4}\\) and \\(\\textsf{5}\\), respectively. Consider the deontic counterpart of axiom \\(\\textsf{4}\\) first:\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{4}$}\n\\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}\\textsf{O}p\n\\]\nWhatever is obligatory ought to remain obligatory. We know that the condition modally defines the requirement that the accessibility relation be transitive. If \\(Rwu\\) and \\(Rut\\), then \\(Rwt\\). That is, if whatever ought to be the case according to \\(w\\) is the case at \\(u\\) and whatever ought to be the case at \\(u\\) is the case at \\(t\\), then whatever ought to be the case according to \\(w\\) is the case at \\(t\\). One way to put it is that the system of norms in force at \\(w\\) remain in force at \\(u\\), which means that the system of norms can only be more restrictive from world to (admissible) world.\nLet us look at \\(\\textsf{5}\\) now: \\[\\tag{5}\n\\textsf{P}p \\to \\textsf{O}\\textsf{P}p\n\\]\nWhatever is permissible ought to remain permissible. So, if \\(p\\) is permissible at a world \\(u\\), then \\(p\\) holds at some world \\(v\\) that is admissible relative to the norms in force at \\(u\\). One way to implement this constraint is to make sure that the system of norms in force at a world never becomes more restrictive from world to (admissible) world. So, no admissible world relative to the norms at \\(u\\) should incorporate further norms.\nOne way to summarize the last two observations is that the combination of \\(\\textsf{4}\\) and \\(\\textsf{5}\\) requires the system of norms to remain constant across worlds, which is, on the face of it, not all that plausible when it comes to familiar types of obligation. At all events, \\(\\textsf{KD45}\\) is a deontic logic that is sound and complete with respect to the class of serial, transitive, and euclidean models.\nThere are intermediate systems between \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) and \\(\\textsf{KD45}\\). One plausible extension of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\) supplements its axioms with axiom \\(\\textsf{U}\\) below: \\[\\tag{$\\textsf{U}$}\n\\textsf{O}(\\textsf{O}p \\to p)\n\\]\nNotice that a world verifies \\(\\textsf{O}p \\to p\\) only if it is an ideal world in which whatever ought to be the case relative to the norms in force at that world is in fact the case. Although it is not very plausible to think that our world is an ideal world, you may nonetheless think that it ought to be the case that the world is an ideal world. This constraint sometimes known as Utopia requires that it ought to be the case than whatever is obligatory is the case. So, this requires admissible worlds to be ones where the standard of obligation are in fact fulfilled.\nThe deontic logic that results, \\(\\textsf{KDU}\\), is sound and complete with respect to the class of serial and weakly reflexive frames. A relation \\(R\\) is weakly reflexive on \\(W\\) if, and only if, for all \\(w\\in W\\) if \\(Rwu\\), then \\(Ruu\\).",

    "text": "11.2 Classic Problems in Deontic Logic\nThe framework of deontic logic invites the formulation of a variety of puzzles. Some of these puzzles arise from the validity of the following derived rule of inference:\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{RK}$}\n\\varphi \\to \\psi / \\textsf{O} \\varphi \\to \\textsf{O}\\psi\n\\]\n\nThe Good Samaritan Paradox\nThe first difficulty arises by reflection on the following fact: \\[\n  \\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\textsf{O}(p \\wedge q) \\to \\textsf{O}q\n  \\] The derivation is simple: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & p \\wedge q \\to q & &   \\textsf{PL} \\\\\n2 & & \\textsf{O}(p \\wedge q) \\to \\textsf{O}q & & \\textsf{RK}, 1\n\\end{array}\n\\] The problem is that this observation appears to license the following inference:\n\nJones ought to help Smith, who has been robbed.\nSmith ought to be robbed.\n\nHere we let \\(p\\) be the proposition that Jones helps Smith and we let \\(q\\) be the proposition that Smith is robbed. You may then take the first premise to express the conjunction of those propositions, which appears to be true. The conclusion, however, is unacceptable.\nOne way out is to reject the formalization of the first premise in terms of \\(\\textsf{O}(p \\wedge q)\\). Maybe we should think of the premise in terms of a conditional obligation: Jones ought to help Smith given that Smith has been robbed. It is one thing to say that the conjunction ought to be the case, which is false, and quite another to say that Jones is subject to a conditional obligation to help Smith given that he has been robbed.\nCompare the distinction just now made with the distinction between a conditional probability and the probability of a conjunction. There is an important distinction to be drawn between the probability of the conjunction that Smith will be robbed and Jones will help Smith, which is low, we may assume, versus the conditional probability that Jones will help Smith given that he has been robbed, which is high given the nature of Jones. Conditional probability, we learn, is not the same as the probability of a conjunction. Likewise, one may say, conditional obligation is not the same as the obligation attached to a conjunction.\n\n\nRoss’ Paradox\nThe next issue involves another application of RK and begins with the following observation:\n\\[\n  \\vdash_{\\textsf{K}} \\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}(p \\vee q)\n  \\] The derivation is again quite simple: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & p \\to p \\vee q & &   \\text{PL} \\\\\n2 & & \\textsf{O}p  \\to \\textsf{O}(p \\vee q) & & \\textsf{RK}, 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe problem is that this observation appears to license the following inference:\n\nThe letter ought to be mailed.\nThe letter ought to be mailed or burned.\n\nHere we let \\(p\\) be proposition that the letter is mailed and we let \\(q\\) be the proposition that the letter is burned. But while the premise seems fine, the conclusion seems strange since one way to discharge the latter obligation is to burn the letter. That in turn is inconsistent with the first way to discharge the disjunctive obligation.\n\n\nChisholm’s Paradox\nFour statements would appear to be perfectly consistent with each other:\n\nYou ought to help your neighbors.\nYou ought to tell your neighbors that you will help them if you will help them.\nIf you will not help your neighbors, you ought to not tell them that you will.\nYou will not help your neighbors.\n\nThe problem is that the scenario turns out to be inconsistent when formalized against the background of the minimal deontic logic. For let \\(p\\) stand for the proposition that you will help your neighbors and let \\(q\\) stand for the proposition that you will tell them that you will help them. Then, we appear to have:\n\n\\(\\textsf{O}p\\)\n\\(\\textsf{O}(p \\to q)\\)\n\\(\\neg p \\to \\textsf{O}\\neg q\\)\n\\(\\neg p\\)\n\nWe now seem to be in a position to argue for a contradiction:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\textsf{O}(p \\to q) \\to (\\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}q)& &  \\textsf{K}  \\\\\n2 & & \\textsf{O}(p \\to q) & &   \\text{ii}  \\\\\n3 & & \\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}q & &   \\textsf{PL}, 1  \\\\\n4 & & \\textsf{O}q & & \\text{i} \\\\\n5 & & \\textsf{O} q \\to \\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg q & & \\text{D} \\\\\n6 & & \\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg q &  & \\textsf{PL}, 4, 5\\\\\n7 & & \\neg p & & \\text{iv} \\\\\n8 & & \\neg p \\to \\textsf{O} \\neg q & & \\text{iii} \\\\\n9 & & \\textsf{O} \\neg q & &\\textsf{PL}, 7, 8 \\\\\n10 & & \\textsf{O} \\neg q \\wedge \\neg \\textsf{O} \\neg q & & \\textsf{PL}, 6, 9\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThis is unacceptable, unless, that is, we are prepared to concede that Chisholm’s scenario is incoherent, which means that we have to find a way to either live with the inconsistency of the first four claims or else find a way to resist the derivation of the contradiction.\nOne immediate suggestion is to question the formalization we proposed on the grounds perhaps that ii and iii ought to be treated on a par. That would result in two candidate alternatives to the original formulation:\n\n\\(\\textsf{O}p\\)\n\\(\\textsf{O}(p \\to q)\\)\n\\(\\textsf{O}(\\neg p \\to \\neg q)\\)\n\\(\\neg p\\)\n\nIn this case, iii would become a consequence of i, which would make the original set redundant.\n\n\\(\\textsf{O}p\\)\n\\(p \\to \\textsf{O}q\\)\n\\(\\neg p \\to \\textsf{O}\\neg q\\)\n\\(\\neg p\\)\n\nIn this other case, ii would become a simple consequence of iv making the original set of statements redundant again.",

    "text": "11.3 Conditional Obligation\nOne common reaction to these problems is to invoke a distinction between obligation and conditional obligation akin to that between probability and conditional probability. The thought is that a conditional obligation is not the same as the obligation to make sure a conditional is true.\nLet us tentatively enrich the language of deontic logic with a new binary operator into the language \\(O(p/q)\\), to express the proposition that it ought to be the case that \\(p\\) given that \\(q\\). That would be the operator one would use to formalize the conditional obligation to tell your neighbors you will help them provided that you will. The question now becomes whether we are in a position to define conditional obligation in terms of unconditional obligation, and it seems clear that the salient alternatives will not do:\n\n\\(\\textsf{O}(p/q):= q \\to \\textsf{O}p\\)\nThis is much too weak to capture conditional obligation, since it makes them true whenever the antecedent is false. It would be trivially true, for example, that I ought to give you a million dollars given that I overslept today.\n\\(\\textsf{O}(p/q):= \\textsf{O}(q \\to p)\\)\nThe problem with this is that in the presence of \\(\\textsf{KD}\\), we can derive: \\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n\\vdash_{\\textsf{KD}} \\textsf{O}p \\to \\textsf{O}(q \\to p) &  & \\vdash_{\\textsf{KD}} \\textsf{O} \\ \\neg q \\to \\textsf{O}(q \\to p)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nBut in connection to the second observation, the fact that you ought not disturb your neighbors should not entail the conditional obligation to argue with them given that you disturb them.\nThere are further problems. Since \\(\\vdash (q \\to p) \\to ((q \\wedge r) \\to p)\\), we learn: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n\\vdash_{\\textsf{KD}} \\textsf{O}(q \\to p) \\to \\textsf{O}((q \\wedge r) \\to p) & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nSo, if you ought to help your new neighbors move in given that they do, then you ought to help them move in given that they do and that they ask you to please not help them.\n\nThe alternative is to treat conditional obligation as a new binary operator governed by its own distinctive rules of inference: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\nq \\wedge \\textsf{O}(p/q) \\to \\textsf{O}p & & & & \\text{Factual Detachment}\\\\\n\\textsf{O}q \\wedge \\textsf{O}(p/q) \\to Op & & & & \\text{Deontic Detachment}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nGiven factual detachment, if your new neighbors will move in tomorrow, and you ought to help them provided that they do, then you ought to help them. On the other hand, the point of deontic detachment is to allow the move from the fact that it ought to be the case that they will move in tomorrow and the conditional obligation to the obligation to help them tomorrow.\nNotice that once we do this, it becomes an option define the original obligation operator in terms of conditional obligation:\n\\[\n\\textsf{O}p := \\textsf{O}(p/\\top)\n\\] The question, however, is how to specify truth conditions for such claims against the background of the possible worlds model theory.",

    "text": "Knowledge\nOne of the uses to which propositional modal logic has been put is to model certain propositional attitudes such as knowledge and belief.\nTo model knowledge, (Hintikka 1962) supplements the language of propositional logic with a family of propositional operators \\(\\textsf{K}_i\\) for a family of epistemic agents \\(i\\in I\\). A formula of the form \\(\\textsf{K}_i \\varphi\\) is read: “agent \\(i\\) knows that \\(\\varphi\\).” Its dual, \\(\\neg \\textsf{K}_i \\neg\\) is symbolized: \\(\\langle \\textsf{K}_i \\rangle\\), is read: “for all agent \\(i\\) knows, \\(\\varphi\\) remains open.”\nHere is the picture as described by (Lewis 1986):\nIn what follows we speak of states rather than worlds, and we take a state \\(v\\) to be accessible from another state \\(u\\) just in case whatever the agent knows to be the case in \\(u\\) is the case in \\(v\\).\nWe may use state models to model real-life examples. Suppose you have lost sight of your phone, which you think, you may have misplaced. In one state, your phone has been stolen (\\(p\\)), whereas in another state you simply forgot to take it with you and has not been stolen (\\(\\neg p\\)). In all epistemically accessible states, however, your phone had been with you just yesterday night (\\(q\\)). That would place you in a state in which you know your phone had been with you yesterday night, \\(\\textsf{K}_i q\\), but you do not know whether your phone has been stolen: \\(\\neg \\textsf{K}_i p \\wedge \\textsf{K}_i \\neg p\\).\nOne way to model the situation is through a model, which consists of two states \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) corresponding to two epistemic alternatives: one in which your phone has been stolen, and one in which it has not been stolen.\nNotice that \\(\\textsf{K}_i q\\) is true at either state because \\(q\\) is true at all epistemically accessible states, yet neither \\(\\textsf{K}_i p\\) nor \\(\\textsf{K}_i \\neg p\\) is true at either state.\nKnowledge provides the ability to locate the actual world in the space of epistemic live options. Your lack of knowledge whether your phone has been stolen is represented by an inability to locate the actual world in the space of epistemic live options above. Nothing you knows enables you to distinguish \\(s_1\\) from \\(s_2\\).\nWe now explain what it is for a formula \\(\\varphi\\) true at a state \\(s\\) in a model \\(M\\) of the form \\((W, \\{R_i: i\\in I\\}, V)\\), written \\(M, s \\Vdash \\varphi\\), inductively.\nWe are now in a position to define truth in a model of epistemic logic.\nThese decisions are not inconsequential. For it follows that agents know all logical truths and that they know what follows from what they know. That is the framework vindicates a rule of necessitation and all substitution instances of axiom \\(\\textsf{K}\\): \\[\\tag{N}\n\\varphi / \\textsf{K}_i \\varphi\n\\]\n\\[\\tag{K}\n\\textsf{K}_i(p \\to q) \\to (\\textsf{K}_ip \\to \\textsf{K}_iq)\n\\]\nThis involves a modicum of idealization: ordinary knowledge is not closed under logical consequence, and it is not all that plausible to think agents ordinarily know all logical truths.\nOne way to cope with this observation is to let \\(\\textsf{K}_i\\) model not ordinary knowledge but rather knowledge by an idealized agent equipped with unlimited logical capabilities. Alternatively, one may instead take \\(\\textsf{K}_i\\) to model implicit knowledge, which is what follows from knowledge we may reasonably attribute to ordinary agents even if it is not explicitly known by them.\nThe next step is to consider the epistemic interpretation of different modal axioms and to ask whether or not they are candidates for the logic of knowledge.\nWhat is known is the case.\n\\[\\tag{T}\n\\textsf{K}_i p \\to p\n\\]\nThe principle that knowledge implies truth is virtually universally accepted, and a firm candidate for the logic of knowledge.\nFrom a semantic point of view, \\(\\textsf{T}\\) requires \\(i\\)-accessibility relations to be reflexive: a state itself is a live epistemic option for an agent.\nBack to the example with which we started, consider what happens if I tell you ‘you do not know it, but your phone has been stolen’, which we could formalize \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\textsf{K}_i p\\). That turns out to be something you can never know. For notice, for example, that \\(\\textsf{K}_i(p \\wedge \\neg \\textsf{K}_ip)\\) is falsified at all states in the model we considered above. More generally, the formula is false at all states of all state models. For if you knew \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\textsf{K}_i p\\), then presumably, you would know both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg \\textsf{K}_ip\\), which would mean \\(\\textsf{K}_ip\\) and \\(\\textsf{K}_i\\neg \\textsf{K}_ip\\). But the latter would only be true if \\(\\neg \\textsf{K}_ip\\), which would contradict the assumption that you know that \\(p\\).\nWhat is known is known to be known.\n\\[\\tag{\\textsf{4}}\n\\textsf{K}_i p \\to \\textsf{K}_i \\textsf{K}_i p\n\\]\nThis is the principle commonly known as the \\(\\textsf{K}\\textsf{K}\\)-principle. It encodes the view that knowledge is transparent to the agent: if you know something, then you know that you know. Presumably, the thought is that agents with unlimited introspection capabilities ought to be able to recognize their own knowledge: agents should be able to introspectively attend to their reasons for belief, which should be conclusive in cases of knowledge and not defeasible by new information.\nFrom a semantic point of view, \\(\\textsf{4}\\) requires the \\(i\\)-accessibility relations to be transitive: if a state \\(t\\) is an epistemic live option for \\(i\\) at \\(v\\), and \\(v\\) is a live option for \\(i\\) at \\(u\\), then \\(t\\) is a live option for \\(i\\) at \\(u\\).\n(Hintikka 1962) adopted axioms \\(\\textsf{T}\\) and \\(\\textsf{4}\\) and identified \\(\\textsf{S4}\\) as a candidate logic for knowledge. His reasons for that is that he regarded axioms \\(\\textsf{B}\\) and \\(\\textsf{5}\\) as implausible epistemic principles.\nWhat is the case is known to be open.\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{B}$}\np  \\to \\textsf{K}_i \\langle \\textsf{K}_i \\rangle p\n\\]\nThis means that what is the case is known to be open as far as one knows. One way to cast doubt upon that principle is by considering the dual: \\[\\tag{$\\textsf{B}_\\Diamond$}\n\\langle \\textsf{K}_i \\rangle \\textsf{K}_i p  \\to p\n\\]\nYou may think that nothing you know rules out that you do know that you left your phone behind back in the classroom. But according to \\(\\textsf{B}_\\Diamond\\), that is only the case if you did in fact leave your phone behind in your classroom. If you did not, then what you know already rules out that you know that you left the phone behind in the classroom.\nThe semantic counterpart of these observations is that we should not automatically rule out failures of symmetry for \\(i\\)-accessibility relations: from the fact that \\(v\\) is an epistemic live option for the agent at \\(u\\), we cannot conclude that \\(u\\) is an epistemic live option for the agent at \\(v\\).\nTo the extent to which \\(\\textsf{KT5}\\) or \\(\\textsf{S5}\\) extends \\(\\textsf{KTB}\\), the above considerations extend to axiom \\(\\textsf{5}\\), which in the presence of \\(\\textsf{T}\\) would give us \\(\\textsf{B}\\).\nWhat is open is known to be open.\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{5}$}\n\\langle \\textsf{K}_i\\rangle p \\to \\textsf{K}_i \\langle \\textsf{K}_i \\rangle p\n\\]\nThere are cases in which agents mistakenly take themselves to know something that is not in fact the case. Because knowledge entails truth, it would be false in that case that the agents know. But the agents might not have access to that information: it may be open to them that they know despite the fact that they do not know that it is open to them to know. One way to put it is that \\(\\textsf{5}\\) would require agents to be immune to error of the sort described, which is again quite implausible.\nConsider the dual:\n\\[\\tag{$\\textsf{5}_\\Diamond$}\n\\langle \\textsf{K}_i \\rangle \\textsf{K}_i p  \\to \\textsf{K}_i p\n\\]\nIf it is open to you that you know something, then you know it.",

    "text": "12.1 Information Flow\nThe insight behind the possible worlds semantics for epistemic logic is that agents locate themselves in the space of epistemic live options by excluding states of the world as live options in light of new information. The Muddy Children puzzle illustrates the dynamic aspect of this update mechanism:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuddy Children\n\n\n\nThree children \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) have been playing outside when they are called back inside by their guardian. Two of them, say \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), have mud on their forehead, but none of them is able to see their own forehead. Each child, however, can see which of the other children are muddy. Once inside, the guardian asserts:\n\nAt least one of you is muddy.\n\nfollowed by an initial request:\n\nIf you know you are muddy, please step forward.\n\nNone of the children will presumably step forward after the first request. Each child will see other children with mud in their foreheads, but none of them will know whether they themselves are muddy.\nMatters change when she repeats the same request for a second time:\n\nIf you know you are muddy, please step forward.\n\nAfter the second request, the two muddy children will step forward while the third stays behind. For they now know that they are muddy.\n\n\nThe example raises a number of questions:\n\nDid the children learn anything new after the announcement that one of them was muddy?\nWhat changed between the initial request when no one stepped forward and the later one when two muddy children did?\nHow did the two muddy children come to know that they had mud in their foreheads?\n\nHere is a diagrammatic representation of the situation before the initial announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Announcement A\n\n\n\nWe represent the relevant states of information with respect to the question at hand by ordered triples of digits, which encode the state of each children in that order. Thus for example:\n\n\\(101\\) encodes the actual state of the world on which \\(a\\) is muddy, \\(b\\) is not muddy, and \\(c\\) is muddy.\n\\(111\\) encodes an epistemic live option for \\(b\\) (though not for \\(a\\) or \\(c\\)) on which all three children are muddy.\n\\(001\\) encodes an epistemic live option for \\(a\\) (though not for \\(b\\) or \\(c\\)) on which only \\(c\\) is muddy.\n\nThe eight nodes correspond to eight states, which consist of different distributions of mud across the children. The nodes are connected by different accessibility relations, which correspond to each child as an epistemic agent. We assume that each relation is reflexive and symmetric: when an edge labeled \\(a\\), for example, connects two nodes, the two states are indistinguishable as far as \\(a\\) is concerned.\nThe effect of the announcement \\(A\\) is to let the children exclude \\(000\\) as a live epistemic option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Announcement A\n\n\n\nWhile announcement \\(A\\) excludes \\(000\\) as actuality, none of the children regarded \\(000\\) as an epistemic live option. That is because each children is able to see mud in the forehead of at least one child.\nThe children learn valuable information from the fact that no one steps forward after the first request, \\(B\\), is made. This is because the children now learn that none of the other two children know that they are muddy. This suffices to rule out states at which there is exactly one muddy child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Request B\n\n\n\nAfter request \\(C\\), \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) will simultaneously step forward since they find no epistemically open alternative at which they are not muddy. On the other hand, \\(b\\) will stay back because she cannot tell which of \\(101\\) or \\(111\\) are actual. That is, \\(b\\) stays back because \\(b\\) cannot rule out that she is not is muddy.\nThat allows the children to eliminate all epistemic alternatives to \\(101\\). So, the epistemic situation after the second request is that the children know exactly who is muddy and who is not muddy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Request C\n\n\n\nNothing changes when we complicate the situation. If, for example, seven out of ten children happened to be muddy, then no one would step forward until after the guardian makes the seventh request at which point exactly those seven children would simultaneously step forward.",

    "text": "12.2 Common Knowledge\nWhat do the children learn after the first announcement? Notice that they all know that at least one child is muddy even prior to the announcement. We may use \\(E\\varphi\\) as an abbreviation for the conjunction: \\[\n\\bigwedge_{i\\in I} \\textsf{K}_i \\varphi,\n\\]\nwhich is read: “it is generally known that \\(\\varphi\\)’’. General knowledge is not sufficient for common knowledge. A group has common knowledge that \\(\\varphi\\) if they all know that \\(\\varphi\\), they all know that they all know that \\(\\varphi\\), they all know that they all know that they all know that \\(\\varphi\\), etc.\nLet us revisit the initial model for the Muddy Children Puzzle and let \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), and \\(p_3\\) be true at exactly states at which each of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), respectively, are muddy, then we may express the fact that at least one child is muddy by means of the disjunction \\(p_1 \\vee  p_2 \\vee p_3\\). Notice that that formula is true when evaluated at state \\(101\\): \\[\nM, 101 \\Vdash \\textsf{E} (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3).\n\\]\nThat is because: \\[\nM, 101 \\Vdash \\textsf{K}_a (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3) \\wedge \\textsf{K}_b (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3) \\wedge \\textsf{K}_c (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3).\n\\]\nBut although it is generally known that at least one child is muddy, it is not common knowledge that at least one child is muddy.\nCommon knowledge plays a crucial role in social interaction. When we drive, for example, we rely on the fact that it is common knowledge that a red light requires drivers to stop. It is not sufficient for a pedestrian to know that, but it is important to know that drivers know that and for them to know that everyone knows that, etc.\nHow should we incorporate common knowledge in the language of epistemic logic? There is no hope for an explicit definition of common knowledge in terms of knowledge, for that would presumably require an infinite conjunction, which is not available in the language. We will instead expand the language of epistemic logic with a common knowledge operator, \\(\\textsf{C}\\varphi\\), reqd: “it is common knowledge that \\(\\varphi\\).\nOnce we do this, we must explain how to evaluate a formula of the form \\(\\textsf{C}\\varphi\\) at a state \\(s\\) of a model \\(M\\) of the form \\((W, \\{R_i: i\\in I\\}, V)\\). To that purpose, we will expand the definition of truth at a state with a clause for the newly added common knowledge operator.\n\na state \\(t\\) is reachable from \\(s\\) in one step, in symbols, \\(sR^1t\\), iff \\(sR_it\\) for some \\(i\\in I\\). In the case at hand, one state is reachable from another in one step if it is \\(a\\)-accessible from the other or it is \\(b\\)-accessible from the other or, finally, it is \\(c\\)-accessible from the other.\na state \\(t\\) is reachable from \\(s\\) in \\(n+1\\) steps, in symbols, \\(sR^{n+1}t\\), iff for some step \\(u\\), \\(sR^{n}u\\) and \\(uR_it\\) for some \\(i\\in I\\).\n\nFor purposes of illustration, notice that in the initial model for the Muddy Children Puzzle \\(000\\) is reachable from \\(101\\) in two steps: \\[\n101 R_c 100 \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ 100 R_a 000\n\\] \\[\n101 R_a 001 \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ 001 R_c 000\n\\]\nThat is, there are two-step paths one may take from \\(101\\) to \\(000\\).\nFinally,\n\na state \\(t\\) is reachable from \\(s\\) in a finite number of steps, in symbols \\(R^\\star\\), iff there is some \\(n\\) such that \\(t\\) is reachable from \\(s\\) in \\(n\\) steps.\n\nHere is the clause for \\(\\textsf{C}\\varphi\\) in the definition of truth at a state: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nM, s \\Vdash \\textsf{C} \\varphi & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W \\ \\text{s.t.} \\ R^\\star su, \\ M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIn other words, \\(\\textsf{C}\\varphi\\) is true at a state \\(s\\) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is true at every state \\(t\\) reachable from \\(s\\) in a finite number of steps.\nLet us revisit the model for the Muddy Children Puzzle prior to the first announcement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Announcement A\n\n\n\nWhen we apply the definition of truth at a state to the case at hand, we find: \\[\nM, 101 \\nVdash \\textsf{C} (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3).\n\\]\nThe reason is that the state \\(000\\), which falsifies the disjunction, is reachable from \\(101\\) in two steps.\nThe situation changes once the children eliminate that option after the announcement. One of the effects of the announcement in the Muddy Children Puzzle is to make it common knowledge that at least one child is muddy: it is not just that all children know that at least one child is muddy, all children now know that all children know, and all children know that all children know that they know that, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Announcement A\n\n\n\nIf we use \\(M'\\) to refer to the model that results, we find \\[\nM', 101 \\Vdash \\textsf{C} (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3).\n\\]\nThis is because the disjunction is true at every state reachable from \\(101\\) in the new model.\nAfter the first request is made without any children stepping forward, the children are able to rule out as epistemic alternatives states in which only one child is muddy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Request B\n\n\n\nAt this point, the fact that two children are muddy now becomes common knowledge, since only states where two children are muddy are reachable from the state of evaluation in a finite number of steps.\nThe actual distribution of mud becomes common knowledge after the two children step forward after the thrid request. That is because they are all left with a single epistemic live option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Request C\n\n\n\nThe accessibility relation for common knowledge, \\(R^\\star\\), will of course be reflexive and transitive. It will be transitive by definition, but it will inherit reflexivity from the reflexivity of each of the \\(i\\)-accessibility relations. Whether the relation will in addition be symmetric or euclidean will crucially depend on the structure of the individual \\(i\\)-accessibility relations.\nOne axiomatization of the logic of common knowledge employs an an axiom and a rule of inference: \\[\\tag{Fixed Point}\n\\textsf{C}p \\to \\textsf{E}(p \\wedge \\textsf{C}p)\n\\] \\[\\tag{Induction}\n\\varphi \\to \\textsf{E}(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi) / \\varphi \\to \\textsf{C} \\psi\n\\]\nThe fixed point axiom regards common knowledge as a fixed point of the function that maps a formula \\(\\varphi\\) to \\(\\textsf{K}_i(\\varphi \\wedge \\textsf{C}\\varphi)\\). The rule of inference is called an induction rule because the antecedent provides the crucial ingredient for an inductive argument for all instances of the schema: \\[\n\\varphi \\to \\textsf{E}^n(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi),\n\\] which guarantees the conditional \\[\n\\varphi \\to \\textsf{C}\\psi.\n\\]\nFor suppose the conditional \\(\\varphi \\to \\textsf{E}(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi)\\) is valid. Then if \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(s\\), \\(\\textsf{E}(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi)\\) is true at \\(s\\), which means that if \\(t\\) is reachable from \\(s\\) in one step, then \\(\\varphi\\) is true at \\(t\\). So, \\(\\textsf{E}(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi)\\) is true at \\(t\\). If \\(u\\) is now reachable from \\(t\\) in one step, then \\(\\textsf{E}(\\psi \\wedge \\varphi)\\) will be true at \\(t\\), etc.\nWe are in a position to prove some theorems of the logic of common knowledge.\n\n\\(\\vdash \\textsf{C}p \\to \\textsf{E} \\textsf{C}p\\)\n\n\nProof. This is a simple consequence of the Fixed Point axiom: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\textsf{C}p \\to \\textsf{E}(p \\wedge \\textsf{C}p) & \\text{Fixed Point}\\\\\n2 & & \\textsf{E}(p \\wedge \\textsf{C}p) \\to (\\textsf{E} p \\wedge \\textsf{E} \\textsf{C}p) & \\textsf{K} \\ 1\\\\\n3 & & \\textsf{C}p \\to \\textsf{E} \\textsf{C}p & \\textsf{PL} \\ 1, 2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\vdash \\textsf{C}p\\to \\textsf{C C}p\\)\n\n\nProof. This is a simple consequence of the rule of inference for common knowledge. \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & & \\textsf{C}p \\to \\textsf{E} \\textsf{C}p & \\\\\n2 & & \\textsf{C} p \\to (\\textsf{C}p \\wedge \\textsf{C} p) & \\textsf{PL} \\\\\n3  & & \\textsf{EC} p \\to \\textsf{E} (\\textsf{C}p\\wedge \\textsf{C} p) & \\textsf{PL}\\\\\n4 & & \\textsf{C} p \\to \\textsf{E} (\\textsf{C}p \\wedge \\textsf{C} p) & \\textsf{PL} \\ 1, 3\\\\\n5 & & \\textsf{C} p \\to \\textsf{CC}p & \\textsf{RC}[\\textsf{C}p/\\varphi, \\textsf{C}p/\\psi] \\ 4\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nHintikka, Kaarlo Jaakko Juhani. 1962. “Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the Two Notions.”\n\n\nLewis, David. 1986.

Nor do they appear to share truth conditions.\n(Stalnaker 1968) offered a pragmatic explanation of the difference, and he meant the minimal change framework to apply to both indicative and counterfactual conditionals.\nIt is not uncommon to use the material conditional to regiment conditionals of the form ‘if the match is struck, it will lit’ as: \\(p \\to q\\). A material conditional of the form \\(p \\to q\\), however, is truth functional: the conditional is true if, and only if, the antecedent \\(p\\) is false or the consequent \\(q\\) is true.

    "section": "The Strict Conditional",
    "text": "The Strict Conditional\nC.I. Lewis responded to the paradoxes of material implication with a new binary connective, which he called the strict conditional. We are now in a position to represent the strict conditional as a necessitation of the material conditional: \\(\\Box (p \\to q)\\).\nThe strict conditional does not vindicate the two types of inference that played a role in the paradoxes of material implication. We are not allowed to move from \\(\\neg p\\) to \\(\\Box (p \\to q)\\) or move from \\(q\\) to \\(\\Box (p \\to q)\\), which suggests progress from the material conditional.\nThe strict conditional, however, supports perfectly parallel patterns of inference: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n& \\Box \\neg p  / \\Box (p \\to q) & & \\Box q / \\Box (p \\to q).  & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nBut it is again not clear that we should be entitled to make inferences such as:\n\nThere are necessarily infinitely many primes.\nTherefore, if there are finitely many primes, then I will win the jackpot.\n\nSimilarly for the inference:\n\nThere are necessarily infinitely many primes.\nTherefore, if I play the lottery, then there will be infinitely many primes.\n\nBut more importantly for our purposes, the strict conditional supports a variety of patterns of inference we found problematic for the indicative conditional. All these rules are valid in against the background of the minimal modal logic \\(\\textsf{K}\\):\n\\[\\tag{Monotonicity}\n\\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi)/ \\Box ((\\varphi \\wedge \\chi) \\to \\psi)\n\\] \\[\\tag{Contraposition}\n\\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi)/ \\Box(\\neg \\psi \\to \\neg \\varphi)\n\\]\n\\[\\tag{Transitivity}\n\\Box(\\varphi \\to \\psi), \\Box(\\psi \\to \\theta)/ \\Box(\\varphi \\to \\theta)\n\\]\nThat suggests that the strict conditional is still not the best candidate to regiment the indicative conditional. Nor does it help that the behavior of the strict conditional is highly sensitive to the modal framework within which it is embedded: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n& \\vdash_{S4} \\Box(\\varphi \\to \\psi) / \\Box \\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & & & \\\\\n&  \\vdash_{S5} \\neg \\Box (\\varphi \\to \\psi) /  \\Box \\neg (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & &  & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]",

    "text": "Conditional Logic\nOne application of the possible worlds framework is the development of a theory of indicative and counterfactual conditionals due to Robert Stalnaker in (Stalnaker 1968) and a subsequent development due to David Lewis in (Lewis 1973). The key thought is that we can explain the truth conditions of indicative and subjunctive conditionals in terms of the material conditional as evaluated in a world that incorporates a minimal departure from the world of evaluation required to make the antecedent true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAn indicative conditional of the form\n\nif \\(p\\), then \\(q\\)\n\nis true at a world \\(w\\) If, and only if, the material conditional \\(p \\to q\\) is true at a \\(p\\)-world which otherwise differs minimally from \\(w\\).\n\n\nA conditional such as ‘if the match is struck, then it will lit’ is true if, and only if, the corresponding material conditional ‘the match is struck \\(\\to\\) the match will lit’ is true at the closest possible world at which the match is struck. While that conditional strikes us as true, the condtional ‘if I play the lottery, then I will win the jackpot’ strikes us as false; on the minimal change approach, the reason is simple: the closest play-the-lottery-world is presumably not a win-the-lottery-world.\nTo make the proposal more precise, let us introduce the language of conditional logic as an extension of the language propositional logic supplemented with a new binary connective for the new conditional.\n\nSyntax\nWe expand the language of modal propositional logic with a binary sentential operator for the new conditional \\(&gt;\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Language of Conditional Logic\n\n\n\nWe define the formulas of a propositional language \\(\\mathcal{L}^\\Box\\) recursively:\n\\[\n\\varphi ::= AT \\ | \\ \\neg \\varphi \\ | \\ (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\ | \\ (\\varphi &gt; \\psi) \\ | \\ \\Box \\varphi\n\\]\nHere is how to read the last line:\n\nAll atoms are formulas.\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula, then \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas, then \\((\\varphi \\to \\psi)\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas, then \\((\\varphi &gt; \\psi)\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula, then \\(\\Box \\varphi\\) is a formula.\n\n\n\nWe read \\(\\varphi &gt; \\psi\\) as the conditional ‘if \\(\\varphi\\), then \\(\\psi\\)’, and we read \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\) as the material conditional ‘not-\\(\\varphi\\) or \\(\\psi\\)’. That means that unlike the indicative conditional, the material conditional is truth-functional.\n\n\nMinimal Change Models\nWe will now make precise the minimal change semantics for the new conditional. To simplify discussion, we omit the accessibility relation for \\(\\Box\\), which we will implicitly assume to the universal relation on \\(W\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pre-Stalnaker Model\n\n\n\nA pre-Stalnaker model is an ordered triple \\((W, \\{\\leq_w : w\\in W\\}, V)\\), where:\n\n\\(W\\) is a non-empty set of worlds.\n\\(\\{\\leq_w: w \\in W\\}\\) is a family of similarity relations for each world in \\(W\\), where for each \\(x, y, w\\in W\\):\n\\(x \\leq_w y\\) is read: \\(x\\) is at least as similar to \\(w\\) as \\(y\\). These similarity relations are reflexive, transitive, strongly connected, and anti-symmetric:\n\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(\\leq_w\\) is reflexive on \\(W\\): for all \\(x\\in W\\), \\(x \\leq_w x\\).\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(\\leq_w\\) is transitive on \\(W\\): for all \\(x, y, z\\in W\\), \\(x \\leq_w y\\), and \\(y  \\leq_w z\\), then \\(x \\leq_w z\\).\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(\\leq_w\\) is strongly connected on \\(W\\): for all \\(x, y\\in W\\), \\(x \\leq_w y\\) or \\(y \\leq_w x\\).\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(\\leq_w\\) is anti-symmetric on \\(W\\): for all \\(x, y \\in W\\), \\(x \\leq_w y\\) and \\(y\\leq_w x\\), then \\(x =y\\).\n\n\\(V\\) is a valuation function for \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), which maps each atom to a subset of \\(W\\).\n\n\n\nWe provide a recursive definition of truth at a world in a pre-Stalnaker model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth at a World\n\n\n\nWe define what is for a formula \\(\\varphi\\) to be true at a world \\(w\\) in a pre-Stalnaker model \\(M\\), which we write: \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nM, w \\Vdash p & \\text{iff} & w \\in V(p)\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi \\ \\text{or} \\ M, w \\Vdash \\psi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W,  \\ M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash (\\varphi &gt; \\psi) & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W, \\text{if} \\\\\n& &  \\ (M, u\\Vdash \\varphi \\  \\text{and for all} \\ v \\in W, \\ M, v\\Vdash \\varphi, \\ \\text{then} \\ u \\leq_w v), \\ \\text{then}  \\\\\n& & \\  M, u \\Vdash \\psi.\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere is a simpler gloss of the truth conditions for \\((\\varphi &gt; \\psi)\\):\n\nfor every \\(u \\in W\\), if \\(u\\) is the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world, then \\(u\\) is a \\(\\psi\\)-world.\n\n\n\nNotice that \\((\\varphi &gt; \\psi)\\) becomes vacuously true at a world \\(w\\) if there is no closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world in the model. That would be the case, for example, if the model contained no \\(\\varphi\\)-worlds at all, or if it contained some \\(\\varphi\\)-worlds but none of them qualified as the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world. In either case, the conditional would be counted as true. Thus for example, the conditional ‘if there are only finitely many primes, then I will win the lottery one day’ comes out true on the approach given above.\nWhile pre-Stalnaker models have some intrinsic interest, they suffer from what Stalnaker deems at least two defects. First, they include no guarantee that each world counts as the closest world to itself. Second, as mentioned above, they do not by themselves guarantee the existence of a closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world even if we are given the existence of some \\(\\varphi\\)-worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Stalnaker Model\n\n\n\nWe define a Stalnaker model to be a pre-Stalnaker model of the form \\((W, \\{\\leq_w : w\\in W\\}, V)\\), which satsifies:\n\nThe Base Assumption:\nFor all \\(w \\in W\\), for all \\(x \\in W\\), \\(w \\leq_w x\\).\nThat is, no world is closer to \\(w\\) than \\(w\\) itself.\nThe Limit Assumption:\nFor all \\(w \\in W\\), if \\(M, w \\Vdash \\Diamond \\varphi\\), then for some \\(u \\in W\\),\n\n\\(M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\), and\nFor all \\(v\\in W\\), if \\(M, v \\Vdash \\varphi\\), then \\(u \\leq_w v\\).\n\nThat is, if \\(\\varphi\\) is possible at \\(w\\), then there is a closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world.\n\n\n\nWe are in a position to define truth and validity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth\n\n\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is true in a Stalnaker model \\(M\\), written: \\(M \\Vdash \\varphi\\), if, and only if for every \\(w \\in W\\), \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity\n\n\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid, written: \\(\\models \\varphi\\), if, and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is true in every Stalnaker model.\n\n\nIn order to become more familiar with these definitions, it will be helpful to provide illustrations of the contrast between valid and invalid formulas of the language of conditional logic.\nWe begin with some examples of validity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\models (p \\wedge q) \\to (p &gt;q)\\).\nThat is, \\((p \\wedge q) \\to (p &gt;q)\\) is true in every Stalnaker model.\nFor let \\(M = ( W, \\{\\leq_w: w\\in W\\}, V )\\) be a Stalnaker model and let \\(w \\in W\\).\nWe now argue that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;q\\) if \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q\\).\nAssume \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q\\) then. To evaluate \\(p &gt;q\\) at \\(w\\), we note that given the Base Assumption, since \\(M, w \\Vdash p\\), \\(w\\) is the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world. Since, by assumption, \\(M, w \\Vdash q\\), we conclude that the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world is a \\(q\\)-world, which means that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\models (p &gt; q) \\wedge (p \\wedge q &gt; r) \\to (p &gt; r)\\).\nThat is, \\((p &gt; q) \\wedge (p \\wedge q &gt; r) \\to (p &gt; r)\\) is true in every Stalnaker model.\nFor let \\(M = ( W, \\{\\leq_w: w\\in W\\}, V )\\) be a Stalnaker model and let \\(w \\in W\\).\nWe now argue that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;r\\) provided that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt; q\\) and \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q &gt; r\\).\nAssume \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt; q\\) and \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q &gt; r\\) then.\nTo evaluate \\(p &gt;r\\) at \\(w\\), we should distinguish two cases:\n\nThere are no \\(p\\)-worlds in \\(W\\) in which case \\(p &gt; r\\) will be vacuously true at \\(w\\) in \\(M\\).\nThere are some \\(p\\)-worlds in \\(W\\) in which case, by the Limit Assumption, there is such thing as the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world, which we call \\(u\\). From the fact that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;q\\), we know that \\(u\\) is a \\(q\\)-world. Since the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world, namely, \\(u\\), is a \\(q\\)-world, \\(u\\) itself must the be the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\wedge q\\)-world. From \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q &gt;r\\), we now infer that \\(u\\) is an \\(r\\)-world. Therefore, since the closest-t-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world is an \\(r\\)-world, we conclude \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\models \\Box (p \\to q) \\to (p &gt; q)\\).\nThat is, \\(\\Box (p \\to q) \\to (p &gt; q)\\) is true in every Stalnaker model.\nFor let \\(M = ( W, \\{\\leq_w: w\\in W\\}, V )\\) be a Stalnaker model and let \\(w \\in W\\).\nWe now argue that \\(M, w \\Vdash p &gt;q\\) provided that \\(M, w \\Vdash \\Box (p \\to q)\\).\nAssume \\(M, w \\Vdash \\Box (p \\to q)\\) then.\nTo evaluate \\(p &gt;q\\) at \\(w\\), we should distinguish two cases:\n\nThere are no \\(p\\)-worlds in \\(W\\) in which case \\(p &gt; q\\) will be vacuously true at \\(w\\) in \\(M\\).\nThere are some \\(p\\)-worlds in \\(W\\) in which case, by the Limit Assumption, there is such thing as the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(p\\)-world, which we call \\(u\\).

Since the closest-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world, namely, \\(u\\), is a \\(\\theta\\)-world, we conclude \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi &gt; \\theta\\).\n\n\n\n(Lewis 1973) thought these principles are patently false for counterfactual conditionals. According to Lewis, we should accept the negation of certain instances of Conditional Excluded Middle for counterfactuals:\n\nIt is neither the case that if Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they would have both been French nor that if they had been compatriots, then they would have not both been French.\n\nEven Conditional Excluded Middle is false, we may be inclined to accept:\n\nIf Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they might have both been French and if Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they might have not both been French.\n\nAccording to Lewis, Distribution is subject to a similar problem. On the one hand:\n\nIf Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they would have both been French or they would have both been Italian.\n\nYet:\n\nIt is neither the case that if Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they would have both been French nor that if they had been compatriots, then they would have both been Italian.\n\nEven Distribution is false, we may be inclined to accept:\n\nIf Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they might have both been French and if Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, then they might have both been Italian.\n\n\n\nAgainst the Limit Assumption\nThe Limit Assumption rules out pre-Stalnaker models in which a formula \\(\\varphi\\) is not true at the world of evaluation \\(w\\), yet it is true at each world occurring in an infinite descending chain of similarity \\((u_n: n\\in \\mathbb{N})\\) where for each \\(n\\), \\(u_{n+1} \\leq_w u_{n}\\). That is, for each \\(\\varphi\\) world in the model, there is a strictly closer-to-\\(w\\) \\(\\varphi\\)-world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterexample to the Limit Assumption\n\n\n\nAccording to Lewis, the Limit Assumption is not an adequate constraint for the evaluation of counterfactuals such as:\n\nIf I had been over 6ft tall, I would have still been below 8ft tall.\nI I had been over 6ft tall, I would have not been over 6ft tall.\n\nOne counterfactual strikes us as true whereas the other strikes us a plainly false. There is, on the face of it, no closest world at which I’m over 6ft tall, which means that the Limit Assumption would seem to fail when it comes to similarity to the actual world.\n\n\nNotice that it is no solution to this problem to fall back to pre-Stalnaker models, since they would still vacuously verify both counterfactuals.\n\n\nSphere Models\nWe focus on a formulation of Conditional Logic in which \\(&gt;\\) is replaced by \\(\\Box \\! \\! \\to\\), which is meant to regiment the counterfactuol conditional. (Lewis 1973) refines the thought that the truth conditions of the counterfactual \\(p \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to q\\) should be explained in terms of the truth conditions of the material conditional \\(p \\to q\\) at \\(p\\)-worlds that are otherwise minimally different from the world of evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA counterfactual conditional of the form\n\nif \\(p\\) had been the case, then \\(q\\) would have been the case.\n\nis true at a world \\(w\\) If, and only if, no \\(\\neg(p \\to q)\\)-world is closer to \\(w\\) than a \\(p \\to q\\)-world.\n\n\nThe counterfactual ‘if the match had been struck, then it would have lit’ is true if, and only if, no world in which the material conditional ‘the match is struck \\(\\to\\) the match will lit’ fails is closer to the actual world than a world at which the conditional obtains.\nTo make the proposal precise, (Lewis 1973) makes use of spheres of similarity: there is, for each world, a nested system of spheres centered on the world of evaluation, which provide a formal representation of the spheres of similarity for that world. Each sphere includes worlds, which are tied to each other with respect to similarity to the world of evaluation, which is placed at the center of the system of spheres. The main constraint is that the closer a world is to the world of evaluation, the closer the sphere of similarity to which it belongs is to the center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nConsider the sphere model represented by the diagram:\n\nThe diagram represents the fact that \\(w_1\\) is closer to \\(w\\) than \\(w_2\\) by placing \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) in different spheres of similarity and by making sure \\(w_1\\) lies in the sphere closer to the center. The minimal departures of \\(w\\) in which \\(p\\) is true are worlds that lie in the innermost sphere where \\(p\\) is satisfied, which is the shaded area in the diagram.\nWe will make \\(p \\ \\Box \\! \\! \\to q\\) to be true at \\(w\\) If, and only if, \\(q\\) is true at \\(p\\)-worlds that are minimally different from \\(w\\), e.g., \\(w_2\\).\n\n\nFor a more formal treatment of sphere models, consider the definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sphere Model\n\n\n\nA sphere model is an ordered triple \\((W, O, V)\\), where:\n\n\\(W\\) is a non-empty set of worlds.\n\\(O\\) is a function from \\(W\\) into a system of spheres \\(O_w\\), which is a set of sets of possible worlds in \\(W\\) for which:\n\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(O_w\\) is strongly centered on \\(w\\): \\(\\{w\\} \\in O_w\\).\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(O_w\\) is nested: for all \\(X, Y\\in O_w\\), \\(X \\subseteq Y\\) or \\(Y \\subseteq X\\).\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(O_w\\) is closed under union.\nfor all \\(w \\in W\\), \\(O_w\\) is closed under non-empty intersection.\n\n\\(V\\) is, as usual, a valuation function for \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), which maps each propositional variable to a subset of \\(W\\).\n\n\n\nThe worlds in a system of spheres \\(O_w\\) strongly centered on \\(w\\) are stratified into spheres or layers according to their distance with respect to the world of evaluation. The innermost sphere or layer \\(\\{w\\}\\) contains \\(w\\), which is the closest world to \\(w\\). And if \\(X \\subset Y\\), then the worlds in \\(X\\) are strictly closer to the world of evaluation \\(w\\) than the worlds in \\(Y \\setminus X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA partial specification of a sphere models will generally include the system of spheres generated by the relation of similarity to the world of evaluation.\n\n\\(W = \\{w, w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6\\}\\)\n\\(O_w = \\{S_1, S_2, S_3\\}\\), where:\n\n\\(S_1 = \\{w\\}\\)\n\\(S_2 = \\{w, w_1, w_2, w_3\\}\\)\n\\(S_3  = \\{w, w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6\\}\\)\n\n\\(V(p) = \\{w_5, w_6\\}\\)\n\nFor a diagrammatic specification, consider:\n\nWe now define what is for a formula to be true at a world in a sphere model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth at a World\n\n\n\nWe define what is for a formula \\(\\varphi\\) to be true at a world \\(w\\) in a sphere model \\(M\\), which we write: \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nM, w \\Vdash p & \\text{iff} & w \\in V(p)\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash (\\varphi \\to \\psi) & \\text{iff} & M, w \\nVdash \\varphi \\ \\text{or} \\ M, w \\Vdash \\psi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash \\Box \\varphi & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W,  \\ M, u \\Vdash \\varphi\\\\\nM, w \\Vdash (\\varphi \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to \\psi) & \\text{iff} & \\text{for every} \\ u \\in W, M, u \\nVdash \\varphi, \\text{or} \\\\\n& &  \\ \\text{for some} \\ S \\in O_w \\ , \\text{some} \\ u \\in S, \\ M, u\\Vdash \\varphi, \\ \\\\\n& &  \\text{and for all} \\ v \\in S, \\ M, v \\Vdash \\varphi \\to \\psi.\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor a simpler gloss of the truth conditions of \\((\\varphi \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to \\psi)\\), call a sphere \\(S\\) a \\(\\varphi\\)-sphere if \\(S\\) contains at least one \\(\\varphi\\)-world. Then:\n\n\\((\\varphi \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to \\psi)\\) is true at \\(w\\) if, and only if either no world is a \\(\\varphi\\)-world or else there is a \\(\\varphi\\)-sphere whose members are all \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\)-worlds.\n\n\n\nThere are no \\(\\varphi\\)-spheres centered on \\(w\\) or else some \\(\\varphi\\)-sphere consists exclusively of \\((\\varphi \\to \\psi)\\)-worlds.\nNotice that \\((\\varphi \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to \\psi)\\) is vacuously true at a world if \\(\\varphi\\) is impossible. So, counterfactuals with impossible antecendents, or counterpossibles for short, come out as vacuously true in every world of every sphere model.\nWe are in a position to define truth and validity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth\n\n\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is true in a sphere model \\(M\\), written: \\(M \\Vdash \\varphi\\), if, and only if for every \\(w \\in W\\), \\(M, w \\Vdash \\varphi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity\n\n\n\nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid, written: \\(\\models \\varphi\\), if, and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is true in every sphere model.\n\n\nIn order to become more familiar with these definitions, it will be helpful to provide illustrations of the contrast between valid and invalid formulas of the language of conditional logic.\nWe begin with some examples of validity. The first one relies on strong centering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\\(\\models (p \\wedge q) \\to (p \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to q)\\).\nThat is, \\((p \\wedge q) \\to (p &gt;q)\\) is true in every sphere model.\nFor let \\(M = ( W, O, V )\\) be a sphere model and let \\(w \\in W\\).\nWe now argue that \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to q\\) provided that \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q\\).\nAssume \\(M, w \\Vdash p \\wedge q\\) then.\nTo evaluate \\(p \\ \\Box \\!\\! \\to q\\) at \\(w\\), we note that since \\(M, w \\Vdash p\\), \\(\\{w\\}\\) is a \\(p\\)-sphere centered on \\(w\\), and since \\(M, w \\Vdash q\\), \\(\\{w\\}\\) is a \\(p\\)-sphere composed exclusively of \\(p \\to q\\)-worlds.\n\n\nWe now illustrate a series of important differences between Lewis’ counterfactual conditional and the material conditional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterexample to Contraposition\n\n\n\n\\(\\not \\models (p \\ \\Box \\!  \\! \\to q) \\to (\\neg q \\ \\Box \\! \\! \\to \\neg p)\\).\nHere is a sphere model in which the material conditional fails.

    "text": "14.1 Basic Language\nQuantified modal logic supplements the vocabulary of quantificational logic with a modal operator \\(\\Box\\). The simplest quantified modal logic extends the axioms of quantificational logic with substitution instances of \\(\\textsf{K}\\) and the rule of necessitation. We will explain how to construct possible worlds models for the language of quantificational modal logic.\nBy way of motivation, we briefly look at the expressive resources we gain when we combine quantification and modality.\nThis distinctions help dispel what might otherwise be thought to be puzzles on the interaction between predication and modality. Furthemore, the framework allows one to make a common distinction between essential and accidental attributes.\nW. V. O. Quine had a more serious objection to the very intelligibility of quantified modal logic. His objection is premised on a certain interpretation of the modality involved in the language of quantified modal logic. Like Carnap and others before him, he took the modality to be linguistic at heart. To claim that necessarily, all bachelors are unmarried is to assert, on their view, that the sentence ‘all bachelors are unmarried’ is analytic or true in virtue of the meaning of the terms involved. What else, they may add, could the necessity involved be?\nThat interpretation is ill-suited to make sense of quantified modal logic. For compare the truth conditions of the two sentences below:\nThe simplest quantified modal logic combines the axioms of quantificational logic with identity with the axioms of the minimal normal modal logic K. That will motivate a simple possible worlds model theory for the language, one that has, however, been controversial. In order to be in a position to discuss the framework, we should review the axioms of quantificational logic with identity.",

More dramatically, consider the converse of \\(\\textsf{BF}\\):\n\\[\n\\Diamond \\ \\exists x \\ \\varphi \\to \\exists x \\ \\Diamond \\ \\varphi.\n\\]So, for example, if it is possible for there to be unicorns, then something is possibly a unicorn.\n\n\nThe Necessity of Identity\nWe are in a position to establish the necessity of identity.\n\\[\n\\tag{NI}\nx= y \\to \\Box \\ x = y\n\\]\nHere is a derivation: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & &  x = y \\to (\\Box  \\ x=x \\to \\Box \\ x =y) & &  \\textsf{II} \\\\\n2 & & x = x & & \\textsf{RI} \\\\\n3 & & \\Box \\ x=x  & &  \\textsf{RN} \\ 2 \\\\\n4 & & x=y \\to \\Box \\ x =y & & \\textsf{PL} \\ 1, 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nThe Necessity of Distinctness\nIn the presence of axiom B, we can derive the necessity of distinctness: \\[\nx \\neq y \\to \\Box \\ x \\neq y  \\tag{$\\textsf{ND}$} \\\\\n\\] Here is a simple argument: \\[\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\n1 & &  \\Diamond \\  x \\neq y \\to x \\neq y & &  \\textsf{NI} \\\\\n2 & & \\Box \\ \\Diamond \\  x \\neq y \\to \\Box \\ x \\neq y & & \\textsf{RK} \\ 1\\\\\n3 & & x \\neq y \\to \\Box \\ \\Diamond x \\neq y & & \\textsf{B} \\\\\n4 & & x \\neq y \\to \\Box \\ x \\neq y & & \\textsf{PL} \\ 2, 3\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe role of axiom B appears to be crucial for the proof. Otherwise, we can provide a model of contingent distinctness by construing identity as indiscernibility and providing a model in which to discernible objects can become indiscernible at a world to which no other world in which the objects exemplify distinct properties is accessible.",
